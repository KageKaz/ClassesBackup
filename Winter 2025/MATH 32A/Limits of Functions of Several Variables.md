# Notes
# finding existence of limit
1. first attempt to see if limit DNE
2. If you see a $\cos$ or $\sin$ use squeeze theorem. if you see $x^2+y^2$, use polar coordinates and then squeeze theorem
# finding non existence of limit
show that two paths have different limits or show that a path doesn't have a limit
check first $x=x_{0}$, $y=y_{0}$
check $y=x$
check$y=mx$
check $y=x^n$
sometimes $y=mx^n$
