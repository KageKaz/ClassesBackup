Peter is beginning to set up a contrast between the worship of ourselves and the true worship of our God. He is going to contrast which direction you go, as far as where your worship will take you. This first section, verses one and two, is all about resolving to suffer for God's will. In other words, resolving in our hearts that if we're going to think about suffering, we should think about it as Christ thought about it. Then, it's worth suffering to defeat sin. We will choose to do what is right, and we would choose to suffer because that's better than living in sin.

If we’re going to pursue anything in this life, it should be God's desires for us. We should live for God's will. So, we resolve to suffer for God's will. Secondly, we determine to suffer for the sake of sanctification. If you're not sure what I mean by sanctification, it’s a word that basically flows out of the concept of holiness. It just means that we grow in holiness. Theologically, we talk about progressive sanctification in this life. Meaning, from the point you become a Christian, as time passes, you take two steps forward and sometimes one step back, but over time, you are growing spiritually.

Sanctification is becoming different from the world around you and more conformed to the image of Jesus Christ. You are being sanctified, set apart, becoming more holy because that is the pursuit of your heart and your desire. Verses three to six give us motivations to encourage us to endure suffering for the sake of our sanctification. I say motivations because verse three talks about what has been done in the past and how you put that away, what is happening in the present and why it's worthwhile, and what is coming in the future which becomes the foundation to endure and to hang on.

Take a look at verse 3. Be done with your sinful past. "For" gives us the reasons or motivations: how or why should we resolve to suffer for God's glory and will? Well, because the time that has passed suffices for doing what the Gentiles want to do—living in sensuality, passions, drunkenness, orgies, drinking parties, and lawless idolatries. The key adjective here is "suffices." It means that something is enough or sufficient. Peter uses it in the sense we often do, not in a passive way, but as if saying, "That’s enough!" Like when a team is down in the fourth quarter, and the quarterback says to his team, "That’s enough, we're taking care of business now."

Peter is saying the time of your past sinning is enough. Be done with it. There has to come a moment in the Christian's life when they say, "I am done with that," and that is the normal expression of a genuine believer. They understand their past life and who they are in Christ. They have this determination to suffer because they’re done with their past. They’re sick of it and want to move forward.

The term used for this idea, that it is past, is a participle in the perfect tense, suggesting that this is something that has happened and will remain in the past. It’s forever in our rearview mirror—this is our resolve. But let me clarify, we’re not talking about Christian perfectionism. We're not saying, "I’m done with my sins of the past and now I don’t sin anymore." That’s not the point. Romans 7 makes it clear there is indwelling sin. Paul said, "The very thing I do not want to do, I find myself doing." I still struggle with sin, though I am God's, justified by His blood.

This struggle with sin is called indwelling sin because it’s the sinful fleshliness that still clings to our souls. One Christian called it "body memory." What they meant was the flesh remembers sin. You have memories of sinfulness that others don't, and those things cling to us. That’s why we should be careful with how detailed we are in our testimonies because those things might remain areas of weakness for us. If you ask a former chain smoker, "When did the desire for a cigarette leave you permanently?" most will tell you, "It never leaves." You just catch a whiff, and the memory returns of what that provided.

The same goes for other areas of life. Indwelling sin, the effects of our sinful nature, and the memory of sin still linger in Christians. But Peter is saying, "The time that is passed concerning sin is enough. Be done with it." Be done with doing the things the Gentiles long to do. Be armed with this way of thinking—that past sinning has been enough. If you’ve sinned a lot before coming to faith, whether much older or younger, be done with it. The amount of sin doesn't matter. The point is to break away and choose the will of God. Suffer if you have to, but be done with your past sins.

If you don’t think about sin this way, you’re in danger. You’re susceptible to falling back into patterns because of "body memory." The Gentiles, those who do not acknowledge God, live a certain way. They live in sensuality, passions, drunkenness, orgies, drinking parties, and lawless idolatries. Scholars suggest that these sins represent elements of pagan idol worship. Sensuality refers to debauchery and lack of restraint, overindulgence in evil. Passions refer to cravings or lusts, and drunkenness means overflowing in alcohol. Orgies and drinking parties refer to wild, excessive gatherings often tied to the worship of Bacchus, the god of wine.

This was not against the law; in fact, it was encouraged. But in God's eyes, these were lawless acts.

In the eyes of a holy God, it is God's laws that are violated. Idolatry and these things are all connected with false worship. This is what pagans want, this is what pagans live for. Be done with your sinful past, including whatever idolatry has come to your souls. Be done with it because you are done with it—Christ has paid for it in full. If you have placed your faith in Him, if you have repented of sin and turned to Christ and said, "I will follow You and now be forgiven of my sins," then you are free.

You have already judicially and legally broken from sin. We need to just walk that out in a way that shows we are done with our sinful past.

Well, how about our present? Verse 4 speaks to that, and I think the encouragement might be that we need to endure our present rejections. Verse 4 says, “With respect to this, they are surprised when you do not join them in the same flood of debauchery, and they malign you.” Two things are said here: first, they are surprised because you’re not joining in, and then, eventually, they malign you.

They are surprised—it’s a word that means they find it strange that you are not participating anymore. They’re surprised that you do not join with them, and it’s a word that means to plunge into the pool together. They’re surprised you don’t jump in as you used to, into the same flood of debauchery. You’re not jumping into the deep end, just like they always have been doing and just like you used to do.

If you have lived a life that has been touched by sinfulness, after becoming a Christian, you enter back into that community or reconnect with that community, and often there is surprise that you’ve chosen a life that is very different from the one you used to enjoy, or that they still enjoy. This is the same idea. It’s not strange for Christians throughout history that the pagan culture they were saved from would look at them and say, “Wait a minute, dude. I know you. We grew up together. We did this, this, and this together, and now you’re holier than thou? Now you’re an apostle of Jesus Christ or something? You’re a holy angel?” They look at us with surprise at first, and then that surprise eventually turns to ridicule.

The term “malign” is the word from which we get the English word “blaspheme.” When it’s directed toward God, it means to blaspheme, to speak wrongly, irreverently, and sinfully about the person, character, and work of God. It means to blaspheme God. But when directed toward human beings, it means to injure the reputation of, to defame, or to revile that individual.

Listen to what one commentator says: “Since heathen religious ceremonies were part and parcel of ordinary life—for example, all civic and national activities were bound up with them—Christians were compelled to avoid what would have seemed to their fellows a wholly innocuous cooperation and to go much further than merely separating themselves from actual heathen worship.”

All this commentator is saying is that it was such a normal part of life in civil society in that pagan culture that if the Christian said, “No, I can’t participate,” their neighbors, friends, and family would become offended. “Dude, what’s the big deal? It’s just a festival for the dead.” I choose that term in particular because there are a lot of festivals for the dead, all of which are pagan worship-inspired.

I think of our friends in Japan, our Christian friends in Japan. Every season, every year, in late summer, there is the Obon festival, and it’s a celebration of the dead. Like many celebrations of the dead in pagan cultures, it usually involves offering prayers to the ancestors and doing all that stuff. The Christians we know have said, “We need to separate from that. That’s a pagan practice. It encourages a false understanding of the normal and good and of the souls in memory of ancestors that have gone before me.” So they break with that tradition, and not just that—it also angers their families.

In their community, everyone participates in this party, and when asked to contribute something, they say, “I can’t. It goes against my conscience.” Others respond, “What’s your problem? We’re just asking you to bring some sushi. What’s the big deal?” You can understand the unbeliever’s perspective—they think this is innocuous. They’re not asking you to worship false gods or commit murder; they’re just asking you to contribute something to their festival.

But Christians understand the terror of that. Many of us have faced similar situations with people we know and care about. This is exactly what Peter is talking about, and Peter is saying, “Listen, I recognize that they are surprised you don’t join in with the same flood of debauchery, and then they malign you. I understand where you’re coming from, and in these present rejections, Peter is saying, ‘Hang on.’” And implied in this passage is the message that it’s worth it.

If you’re sitting here wondering, “Is the Christian life worth it?” I encourage you to examine the lives of genuine believers. Through their living and their speaking, through how they conduct themselves and what they value, you’ll see that Jesus Christ is worth it.

And Christian, if you feel like you haven’t been walking with that kind of integrity, be done with your past sins, and realize in your heart presently, even if it causes rejection and people blaspheme you, it’s worth it—because He’s worth it.

Our last point is in verses 5 and 6: trust your final vindication. Verse 5 says, “But they will give account to Him who is ready to judge the living and the dead.” For this is why the gospel was preached even to those who are dead, that though judged in the flesh the way people are, they might live in the spirit the way God does.

Let’s take verse 5 first. “They”—who are they? Your pagan fellows, family members, neighbors, coworkers, friends, who have gone from being surprised to now maligning you. Peter reminds the Christian, “They will all give an account to Him who is ready to judge the living and the dead.” Two things to take away from how Peter expresses that:

1. He is talking about Jesus Christ.
2. No one will get away with anything. They will all give an account.

Jesus says in Matthew 12 that people will give an account for every careless word they speak. Friends, I have to say, I have a lot of words. I say probably too much, too many times. You might think this message has too many words, right? I’ve said some stupid things, some careless things, and some really sinful things—thoughtlessly, off the cuff. Someone has to pay for that in full. There’s no getting away from that debt.

It’s a reminder that we’re not just talking about the big sins, as if God looks past the small ones. Jesus says, “Every careless word will be accounted for on that day.” Romans 14:12 says each one of us will give an account of ourselves to God. Hebrews 4:13 says no creature is hidden from His sight, but all are naked and exposed to the eyes of Him to whom we must give an account. They will give an account to Him who is ready to judge the living and the dead.

There must have been some unbelievers who said to these Christians, “Whatever, man. You found religion—great. God bless you, fool. We don’t care because in the end, we’re not missing out on anything good. YOLO—You Only Live Once, right? You’re going to die, I’m going to show up at your funeral and say, ‘Yeah, that fool said he was living a holy life, and you know what? He had no fun, and now he’s dead. But I lived a fun, full life, and now I’ll die too.’”

It almost sounds right, like the other side of the coin of what the preacher says in Ecclesiastes. Do you remember Ecclesiastes? He opens with the idea of “vanity of vanities,” and one of his arguments is this: if you are rich like a king, or poor like a beggar, you both end up in the grave. If you are really wise and careful, or live like a fool, you both die.

But in Ecclesiastes, the preacher is saying this is life under the sun—if you don’t consider what’s above the sun, what’s spiritual and eternal. The final word of Ecclesiastes in chapter 12 is this: “The end of the matter; all has been heard. Fear God and keep His commandments, for this is the whole duty of man. For God will bring every deed into judgment, with every secret thing, whether good or evil.”

Peter’s argument is that suffering can be useful for sanctification, for your growth in holiness. Because one, you will be done with your sinful past. Two, in present rejections where the world might despise you, you will endure because it is good and glorious for your sanctification. And three, you will trust in the final vindication to come, because God is ready to judge the living and the dead. No one gets away with anything—because God knows and He sees everything.

That is motivating for us, because of what verse 6 says—and we’ll finish with this: “For this is why the gospel was preached even to those who are dead, that though judged in the flesh
