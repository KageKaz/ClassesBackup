### Introduction to Functionalism and Color Experience

It’s possible for two individuals to be perfectly burdened by the same mental states and color experiences throughout their lives without ever realizing they perceive things differently. If this were true, it would challenge **functionalism**—the idea that mental states are defined by what they do rather than by their intrinsic qualities. For example, functionalism would suggest that visual experiences, like seeing colors, are simply defined by their functions, not by the actual subjective experience of seeing white, red, or any color.

### Intrapersonal Case and Color Inversion

Dennis raises an interesting issue about color experience with the **intrapersonal case**. He suggests that over years, someone could experience color in a consistent way but might one day wake up with their color experiences inverted (e.g., seeing red tomatoes as green). This shift could either be a change in their phenomenal experience (how colors are perceived) or a shift in their **memory, judgments, and beliefs** about color. From the inside, the person might not be able to distinguish between these two possibilities.

### Implications for Subjective Experience

The deeper implication, Dennis argues, is that if we cannot be sure about these changes even within ourselves, why should we be confident about **interpersonal cases** (comparing two people’s experiences)? If it’s impossible to tell internally whether someone’s color experience has changed, this raises doubts about the ability to discern differences between two people’s subjective experiences. He also highlights that this challenges the notion that subjective experiences are self-evident or immediately accessible.

### Criticism of Subjective Experience as Inherently Accessible

Dennis argues that subjective experiences, often considered to be directly accessible or **self-verifying**, might not be as straightforward as they seem. He suggests that even in cases where someone’s color experience has changed, they might not be aware of it without external investigation. This leads to the conclusion that subjective experience might not reveal everything about itself.

### Phenomenal Experience vs. Cognitive Judgments

Dennis contrasts two possibilities for color inversion:

1. The phenomenal experience (the subjective sensation of seeing color) could be what changes.
2. Alternatively, the person’s **memories, judgments, and beliefs** about color might shift, rather than their direct experience.

The difficulty lies in determining from the inside which one has happened. This inability to tell apart different hypotheses about one’s own experience raises questions about how we understand our inner lives and challenges the idea that we can fully grasp our mental states just by introspection.

### The Thought Experiment: Phenomenal Switch or Cognitive Shift?

Dennis uses a thought experiment to show that it’s difficult to tell whether a person’s color spectrum has been inverted (e.g., tomatoes appearing green). The key point is that for all a person knows, their **cognitive judgments** about color, rather than the colors themselves, might have changed. This challenges the assumption that **inner experiences** are always directly accessible or infallible.

### Intrinsic vs. Relational Properties

Dennis also touches on the distinction between **intrinsic** and **relational properties** in subjective experience. He argues that for something to be a true **qualia** (the subjective aspect of experience), it must have intrinsic properties, meaning it should exist independently of any relation to other things. In contrast, relational properties are defined by their connections to other objects or experiences (e.g., a color being "redder" than something else).

### Discussion of Perceptual Experience

Perceptual experiences, Dennis argues, are often treated as **intrinsically subjective**—they are assumed to be private and directly accessible to the individual. But his thought experiments suggest that these experiences might not be so easily separable from **cognitive judgments** and other mental states. This challenges the traditional notion that perceptual experiences are purely about internal sensations.

### Group Discussion and Cognitive Science Perspectives

In group discussions, participants grappled with the relationship between **perceptual experiences** and other mental states like judgments, beliefs, and emotions. Cognitive scientists often distinguish between "hot" mental states (like emotions) and "cold" ones (like beliefs), but recent research suggests that even cold states might have phenomenal qualities. This opens up questions about whether all mental states, not just perceptual experiences, can be subjective in nature.

### Concluding Thoughts on Subjective Experience

Dennis' arguments raise fundamental questions about the nature of subjective experience. If even our most basic perceptual experiences can’t be fully trusted from the inside, how confident can we be about our understanding of the mental states of others? This presents a challenge for **functionalism**, which relies on the idea that mental states can be defined solely by their functional roles rather than by any intrinsic qualities.

In the end, the discussion points to a deeper, unresolved tension between the idea that subjective experiences are private and immediate and the possibility that they might be more relational or cognitively dependent than previously thought.

### Introduction to Conditioning and Associationism

In today's lecture, we're going to explore concepts related to conditioning and associative learning, particularly focusing on how organisms form associations between stimuli. We're also going to delve into some of the prominent theories and experimental findings in this field. Let's begin with classical conditioning and how it was discovered and understood.

### Classical Conditioning: Pavlov’s Dog Experiment

The classical experiment that introduced the concept of conditioning involved Pavlov’s dogs. The basic premise was that an unconditioned stimulus (food) would naturally cause an unconditioned response (salivation). During the experiment, Pavlov paired a neutral stimulus, like the sound of a bell, with the unconditioned stimulus. After repeated pairings, the dogs began to associate the bell with the food, eventually salivating in response to the bell alone, without any food being presented.

This demonstrated that an organism's natural response (like salivation) could be conditioned to occur with a previously neutral stimulus (the bell). This is a key point in understanding how new behaviors and responses can be learned through association.

### Extending Classical Conditioning

The surprising aspect of Pavlov's findings was that this type of learning could occur with various stimuli—any sound, smell, or tactile sensation could be used to elicit the salivation response if paired with food. This suggested that the learning process wasn’t limited to specific stimuli but could generalize across different sensory inputs.

### Extinction and Counterconditioning

Pavlov and later researchers discovered a concept called "extinction," where conditioned responses can gradually diminish if the conditioned stimulus (the bell) is repeatedly presented without the unconditioned stimulus (the food). For example, if the bell was rung repeatedly without giving the dog food, the salivation response would eventually stop.

However, extinction is not always permanent. Sometimes, the conditioned response can randomly reappear, a phenomenon known as "spontaneous recovery." This suggests that the association may not be entirely erased during extinction.

Another approach, called "counterconditioning," involves changing the valence of the association. For example, if a dog had been conditioned to associate a bell with food, you could change the association by pairing the bell with something unpleasant, like a mild shock. This would create a new negative association with the previously positive stimulus.

### The Limits of Extinction: The Example of Phobias

This leads us to a discussion of associative learning in humans, particularly in the case of phobias. A powerful example of a long-lasting, emotionally charged learned association is a phobia. Even if a person rationally understands that a stimulus (like a spider) is not dangerous, they may still experience a strong, involuntary emotional reaction because of a learned association. Attempts to explain this suggest that associative learning doesn’t function like belief formation—it’s not easily undone by reasoning or persuasion.

### The Role of Associations in Beliefs

In discussing associative learning, it’s crucial to distinguish between beliefs and associations. Beliefs are structured, propositional attitudes—thoughts like "today is Wednesday" or "there are chairs in the room." These beliefs involve attributions of features to objects or events. On the other hand, associations, like those formed through classical conditioning, are often unstructured and automatic. For instance, a person might associate the smell of a certain food with nausea, without any propositional thought linking the two.

### Measuring Associations

Researchers measure associations by examining how quickly one stimulus brings another to mind. For example, if the word "lipstick" quickly brings to mind the concept of "women," this suggests a strong associative link between the two. These associations, unlike beliefs, don’t posit relationships or detailed explanations between the linked concepts.

### Propositional Learning vs. Associative Learning

One major debate in psychology is whether associative learning is propositional in nature or not. Some researchers argue that associative learning involves judgments—such as "the bell signals food"—which would suggest a more structured, inferential form of learning. However, others maintain that associations are unstructured and automatic, not reliant on conscious judgments.

### Evidence from Simple Organisms

Support for the idea that associative learning is not propositional comes from studies on simpler organisms. Even organisms with very basic nervous systems, like snails, can display associative learning. This suggests that sophisticated cognitive processes, like forming propositions or making inferences, aren’t necessary for associative learning to occur.

### Phobias as Evidence for Non-Propositional Learning

Another piece of evidence for non-propositional associative learning comes from phobias. Even when people know that something is not dangerous, like a harmless spider, they may still have a strong emotional response due to a learned association. This suggests that phobias, and other deeply ingrained emotional responses, might be driven by non-propositional, associative processes.

### Conclusion: Implications of Associative Learning

Associative learning plays a crucial role in both animal and human behavior, shaping how we respond to stimuli in the world around us. Understanding the difference between propositional beliefs and associative links helps us explain why certain responses, like phobias or conditioned reflexes, can be so powerful and resistant to change.

In our next class, we will delve deeper into the theoretical implications of these findings and explore how they challenge traditional views of learning and cognition.

### Introduction: Objection to Promise Two

Now, that might not be enough to remove the inferential connection. So you're objecting to promise two?

Yes, I think I would object to promise two. If I were to object to one of them, it would be promise two.

What do you think? What exactly are you objecting to in promise two? The idea is, just because inferential learning is supposed to be susceptible to argumentation, that doesn't necessarily mean that every valid argument is going to change your inference, right?

Like, what he’s saying is that maybe the original inference is so baked into your brain that even if you know it’s irrational, it’s hard to change. Sometimes people will hear a rational argument and still refuse to be persuaded.

### Mitchell's Perspective on Inferential Learning

I think that’s what Mitchell was trying to say: that inferential learning was formed through an argument-like process, but it can't be undone through the same kind of process.

And even if the original process was sound, it wouldn’t be irrational, right? You wouldn’t have an irrational fear, but because roots can be invalid... Yeah, that makes sense.

I’m just repeating what I read in the reading. Honestly, I didn’t read it all—I didn’t have time. It’s probably a waste of time, honestly.

Oh really? I mean, you’re getting most of it.

Yeah, that’s what I thought.

### Reasons for Resistance to Reason

He gave three possible reasons why an arachnophobe might not be persuaded by reason. I can’t remember the third one. Do you?

Well, the first one was...

I didn’t do the reading.

Okay, I’ll pull it up in a second. The first reason was that the arachnophobe might act as if they are persuaded socially, saying, “I understand that spiders are harmless,” but they don’t really believe it.

Oh, I remember now! The third reason was really interesting. The second one was about inferential connections—that they are formed through inferences but can’t be undone by inferences. The third reason was that maybe arachnophobia is not an inferential connection at all. Maybe it's genetic, an untrained, unconscious stimulus. It wouldn’t have anything to do with learning—it’s already there.

### Evolutionary Argument: Fear of Spiders

In the past, it would have made a lot of sense to be suspicious of spiders because we didn’t have the science to know they’re harmless. So, our ancestors’ genetic predisposition made us fear spiders.

That’s more of a spider-specific argument.

Yeah, but I thought it was pretty compelling.

### Evidence for Inferential Learning

So, what’s the evidence that something can be learned through inference but not unlearned through inference? In the reading, the author went over several experiments. One showed that if people make an association while distracted, they may still form the association. This suggests that they need conscious attention for some associations, implying inferential learning.

### Propositional vs. Associational Learning

Does the author think that associational learning doesn’t exist at all? That there always has to be some minimal thought process behind it?

He wasn’t really committal in his argument. He and his co-authors seemed to lean toward the idea that there isn’t a strong reason to believe in associational learning on top of propositional learning. He argued that if you accept that propositional learning exists, adding associational learning doesn’t fix the problem of explaining neural connections.

Associational learning seems more intuitive because of the way neurons are linked, and we see it in animals, which could suggest it also exists in humans. However, the author was partial to the belief that humans have elevated cognition that distinguishes them from other animals.

### Cognitive Differences Between Humans and Animals

That’s a big distinction. Lower animals, with less cognitive ability, may form associations that aren’t inferences because they can't make inferences.

Yes. He mentioned some primitive multicellular organisms that could make responses, but he also noted that lab rats were capable of associative learning. He mentioned experiments about lab rats.

That makes sense. I’ve heard of lab rats learning to navigate mazes. The part that stuck out to me was when he said that associative learning can still be conscious. Even if the learner wasn’t consciously engaged, they can often explain the association afterward.

### The Role of Attention in Learning

The mainstream psychological view is that inference and association work together all the time. We have sophisticated learning processes that engage us in philosophical thinking, but we also have associative processes, like phobias. The argument from phobias is supposed to be a strong example for the existence of associative learning structures.

For example, you might have an irrational negative association with something like mustard and ketchup. These associations are permanent and hard to change, even with reasoning.

Phobias are one of the strongest arguments for the existence of associative structures, as they are often resistant to reasoning or counter-arguments.

### Conclusion: Associative Learning and Propositional Learning

The author made the case that while associative learning could theoretically be undone by repeated exposure (like exposure therapy), it's harder to undo because it's tied to unstructured concepts. The processes that support these unstructured attitudes are different from those supporting propositional attitudes, which are based on structured beliefs.

In conclusion, he was making a controversial argument that all associative learning could actually be propositional. The research presented doesn’t fully support this, but there are experiments suggesting that attention is required for learning associations, at least in some cases.

So, in the end, the question remains: are the processes supporting associative learning distinct from those that support propositional learning?
