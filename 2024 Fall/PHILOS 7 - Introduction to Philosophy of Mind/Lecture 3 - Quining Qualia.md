### Introduction to Functionalism

Functionalism is a theory about mental states that emphasizes their roles or functions, rather than their internal constitution. Philosophers describe mental states in terms of their "dispositions" — that is, the tendencies to behave in certain ways, influenced both by external environmental forces and internal cognitive processes.

### Behavioral Dispositions and Mental States

A key question raised in functionalism is whether _all_ behavioral dispositions matter or only some. Mental states influence behavior and interact with other mental states. For two mental states to be the same kind of state, they must have the same functional role. This is a broad characterization of dispositions, covering behaviors that might not be immediately observable.

### Functional Roles and Objects

Objects, like mental states, also have functional roles. For example, a bottle has a disposition to fall if you loosen your grip, but it does not actually fall unless you release it. The functional role of the bottle is a suite of dispositions that remain even if the behaviors are not currently manifest.

Similarly, mental states like desires have dispositions that might not always lead to observable actions. If you desire sushi later, that mental state disposes you to seek out sushi, even if you don't follow through with it. The bottle’s disposition to fall and your desire for sushi both illustrate how functionalism understands latent behavioral tendencies as central to the nature of things.

### Functionalism and Mental States

Functionalism proposes that mental states are defined by their roles in a network of dispositions. The mind, according to functionalism, is a system of mental states interacting with one another and with the external world. This view implies that to understand a mental state, we need to examine how it is influenced by the environment and how it influences other mental states and behaviors.

For example, the belief that today is Monday includes a suite of dispositions to say "today is Monday," to attend Monday classes, and to adjust your schedule based on the belief. Even if none of these actions occur, the mental state of believing it is Monday is still present because of the underlying dispositions.

### The Inverted Spectrum Thought Experiment

A classic thought experiment in philosophy, often discussed in the context of functionalism, is the **Inverted Spectrum Argument**. This theoretical possibility suggests that two individuals could have the same functional roles but experience colors completely differently. One person might see what we call "red" as what the other person sees as "green," yet both call the fire hydrant "red" because their behaviors and dispositions are identical.

This argument raises the question of whether functionalism captures everything about mental states, especially the subjective quality of experience, sometimes called _qualia_. If two people have identical functional roles but differing internal experiences, it suggests that functionalism may overlook something essential.

### Extending the Inverted Spectrum to Other Mental States

Could this kind of inversion happen with other mental states, such as semantic beliefs or shapes? Some philosophers argue that while perceptual experiences like color might be inverted, other states (like the belief that "there are more than 50 people in this room") might not be subject to such inversion. However, it’s possible that functionalism could face similar challenges if other kinds of mental states were also subject to internal variation not captured by functional roles.

### The Limits of Functionalism

The inverted spectrum raises doubts about whether functionalism can fully explain mental states. Functionalism claims to provide a theory of mental states across all possible beings — whether human, animal, artificial intelligence, or even extraterrestrial. If functionalism cannot account for differences in subjective experience that don't affect behavior, this presents a challenge to the theory.

### Formal Restatement of Functionalism

In formal terms, two mental tokens (individual instances of mental states) are of the same kind if they have the same functional role. For example, if both you and I believe it is Monday, those beliefs are considered the same type of mental state because they fulfill the same functional role. Functional roles consist of dispositions to respond to the environment, influence other mental states, and change the environment.

### Inverted Spectrum: A Problem for Functionalism

If it is possible for two individuals to have identical functional roles but inverted experiences, functionalism may fail to capture the full nature of mental states. This is the core argument against functionalism posed by the inverted spectrum thought experiment. If functional roles cannot explain subjective differences, functionalism is incomplete.

### Functionalism and Complex Interactions

One student raised the question of whether functionalism accounts for interactions between mental states, such as how external factors (like weather) can suppress or alter behavioral dispositions. Functionalism does indeed consider these interactions. For instance, if you want sushi but it’s snowing outside, the weather might suppress your behavior of going to get sushi, but the underlying disposition remains.

### Differentiating Between Perceptual and Non-Perceptual States

Another student asked whether it is possible to be a functionalist about non-perceptual states (like beliefs or desires) but not about perceptual states (like seeing red). Functionalists can indeed make this distinction, and some argue that while functionalism might work for cognitive states, it struggles with perceptual states where subjective experience (qualia) plays a larger role.

### Daniel Dennett and the Denial of Qualia

Philosopher Daniel Dennett has argued that there is no such thing as _qualia_, the inner subjective experience often considered a challenge to functionalism. In his provocative paper, Dennett argues that what we call subjective experience can be explained in terms of functional roles and behaviors. He suggests that there is no extra subjective quality beyond what functionalism can explain.

Dennett’s argument challenges the view that qualia are intrinsic, private, and immediately apprehensible aspects of mental states. By questioning these assumptions, Dennett aims to show that the concept of qualia might not be necessary to understand mental states.

### Conclusion

Functionalism provides a framework for understanding mental states as systems of dispositions that interact with the environment and other mental states. However, challenges like the inverted spectrum thought experiment and the concept of qualia raise questions about whether functionalism can account for the full nature of subjective experience. Philosophers like Dennett have proposed that subjective experience might not be as distinct from functional roles as we think, but this remains a matter of debate in the philosophy of mind.

### **Arguments on Immediate Apprehensibility of Experience**

The argument centers around whether subjective experience or qualia (the qualities of experiences) is immediately apprehensible. Dennett seems to suggest there is no reason to think that subjective parts of experience can be directly accessed or known without mediation. In his work, he challenges the notion that experiences possess intrinsic qualities that can be immediately grasped, as opposed to relational qualities that depend on external conditions.

Claudia questions whether Dennett is arguing that there are no subjective experiences at all, or just that we can't immediately apprehend them.

### **Intrinsic vs. Relational Qualities of Experience**

The discussion moves into the idea of intrinsic features of experiences. According to Dennett, intrinsic features are those qualities an object possesses independently of its relationship to other objects. For instance, qualities like "being round" or "being green" are thought of as intrinsic, but Dennett points out they are actually relational, as they depend on comparison to other things. He argues that subjective experiences, if they exist, would have to be both inevitable and ineffable—difficult to describe or convey fully.

The example of visual experience is explored here, with the suggestion that even color is relational rather than intrinsic. The fact that we see green or orange depends on context, lighting, and other relational aspects.

### **Ineffability and Private Experience**

Another important characteristic Dennett points to is the supposed ineffability of subjective experience. There’s a part of subjective experience that is allegedly private and can’t be fully communicated or made public. While we can try to describe subjective feelings (e.g., melancholy), the argument suggests that there's a private part we cannot express.

For instance, one might explain feeling sad, but the full depth of that sadness, the exact subjective experience, can’t be completely conveyed to others. This ineffability is seen as a hallmark of qualia.

### **Immediate Access to Subjective Experience**

Dennett questions whether subjective experiences are immediately apprehensible, meaning that we don’t need to investigate further to know what we are experiencing. Immediate apprehensibility would imply direct, unmediated access to the nature of an experience, but Dennett argues that this might not always be the case. For example, you might feel a sensation but be uncertain about its cause or nature without further investigation.

In the case of subjective experiences like sadness or a taste, we might feel something but not immediately understand or describe it fully.

### **Thought Experiments: Inverted Spectrum**

Dennett employs thought experiments, such as imagining two creatures with inverted color spectra. Though their functional mental states and behavior remain identical, their subjective experiences of color are reversed. The question is: can they know the difference? He suggests that from the inside, it might be impossible to tell. This example aims to weaken the intuition that qualia are immediately accessible, as two individuals could have different experiences without knowing it.

The inverted spectrum thought experiment leads to the idea that even if there is a shift in our experiences, like a color inversion, we might not know it without investigation. This could undermine the assumption that qualia are immediately accessible or even that they exist as traditionally conceived.

### **Interpersonal vs. Intrapersonal Inversion**

Dennett distinguishes between **interpersonal** inversion (two people with inverted experiences) and **intrapersonal** inversion (where one person’s experiences change over time). He suggests that we could imagine waking up one day and finding our visual experience of colors is flipped. However, it may not be immediately clear whether the change is in the experience itself or in our memories and associations.

This distinction is crucial because it suggests that subjective experience might be altered or reconstructed without us being immediately aware of the change. Even if we feel like something has changed, it could be that our memories or interpretations, not our actual experiences, have shifted.

### **Gradual Changes in Experience: Coffee Taste Example**

Dennett uses the example of coffee taste to further his argument. Imagine you regularly drink coffee, and one day it suddenly tastes different to you. The question is whether your experience of the taste has changed, or whether your evaluation and thoughts about it have shifted. Even if the taste seems different, you might not be able to tell if the change is in the experience itself or in your subjective interpretation of it.

This example demonstrates how even seemingly direct experiences like taste might not give us clear access to whether an actual experiential change has occurred.

### **Dennett's Skepticism of Immediate Apprehensibility**

Dennett argues that if subjective experiences are consistent with multiple possible explanations—such as a shift in perception versus a change in memory or evaluation—then they cannot be immediately apprehensible. This challenges the idea that we have direct access to our experiences without needing further inquiry.

For example, you might think your taste in coffee has changed, but it could be that your associations or beliefs about the taste have shifted, not the experience itself. According to Dennett, this suggests that qualia may not be as accessible or knowable as some might believe.

### **Reflection and Group Discussion**

Students are then encouraged to reflect on these ideas in small groups. The discussion focuses on whether subjective experience must be immediately apprehensible to count as "qualia" and whether Dennett’s argument convincingly undermines the existence of qualia. Some students express confusion, while others try to articulate both sides of the argument.

### **Philosophical Complexity and Confusion**

The students discuss the difficulty in understanding Dennett’s argument and its implications. Some express frustration with philosophy's complexity, particularly the abstract nature of concepts like qualia. Others debate whether the existence of subjective experience is undermined simply because it’s not immediately apprehensible. They question whether experiences like taste or visual perception really need to meet Dennett’s stringent criteria to count as subjective experiences.

### **Subjective Experience and Qualia**

One of the complexities of discussing subjective experience is that it often involves terminology that can be confusing. For example, subjective experience, or "qualia," refers not to whether there's an opinion about something, but rather to the inner felt part of the experience that is independent of our behaviors. This terminology can sometimes be more confusing than illuminating. A key question is whether these inner experiences can exist without our conscious realization of them.

### **The Inverted Spectrum Thought Experiment**

The inverted spectrum argument is a popular philosophical thought experiment that suggests the possibility of two people having different inner experiences (such as seeing different colors) but behaving in the same way. In this scenario, if two people experience colors in an inverted manner (one person’s red might be another’s green), can this ever be detected?

The philosopher we are discussing is curious whether this inverted spectrum idea can also apply to a single person. In other words, can an individual’s experience change radically without them knowing? This leads to a deeper examination of the nature of subjective experience and whether it's as private or inaccessible as it might seem.

### **Inner Experience and Its Features**

The discussion introduces the idea that if there is such a thing as inner felt experience, a person should at least be aware if it changes drastically. The philosopher speculates on whether today's sensory experiences, such as taste, can switch without us noticing. This connects to the idea that our inner judgments, memories, and associations might be what change, rather than the experience itself. This shift could explain why the concept of "qualia" is difficult to pin down.

### **Intrinsic vs. Relational Features**

When philosophers refer to something as "intrinsic," they are distinguishing it from relational qualities. For example, being "red" is considered an intrinsic feature, while being "next to" something is a relational feature. The philosopher argues that intrinsic features are not constituted by their relation to other things. In this context, subjective experience, or qualia, may be intrinsic, but it remains difficult to determine precisely how these experiences exist independently of external factors.

### **Challenges in Describing Inner Experiences**

One of the major challenges in understanding subjective experience is that it can be extremely difficult to describe. The philosopher argues that while it may be practically hard to convey subjective experiences, this doesn't necessarily mean it's impossible. For example, describing a sound or feeling might be complicated, but not theoretically impossible. He suggests that our struggles to describe experiences, like the sound of a train or a musical note, could stem from our current limitations in language, not from an inherent inability to describe such experiences.

### **Privacy and Discoverability of Experiences**

A central question is whether inner experiences are inherently private or if they can be shared through language or other means. The philosopher points out that while experiences may seem private, this privacy is not absolute. For instance, if we had sufficient technology or methods, we might be able to discover whether two people experience colors or sounds in the same way. He suggests that inner experiences may be practically private but not necessarily inaccessible.

### **Effability of Inner Experiences**

The philosopher delves into the concept of "effability"—the ability to describe an experience. While some argue that inner experiences are ineffable, meaning they cannot be described, the philosopher proposes that this ineffability might be overstated. He believes that, given enough time and effort, it might be possible to describe even the most complex inner experiences in a way that makes them understandable to others, though perhaps not in an identical or exact way.

### **Skepticism and Qualia**

Ultimately, the philosopher questions whether qualia, or inner experiences, exist in the way we think they do. He suggests that perhaps the notion of inner experience is something we’ve misunderstood or overestimated. The argument is not that subjective experiences don’t exist, but that our understanding of them may be incomplete or inaccurate, especially when we assume they are entirely private, ineffable, or intrinsic.

### **Student Reflections and Discussions**

During the lecture, students raise interesting points about how subjective experience can or cannot be described. One student mentions that some people are particularly good at describing emotions or sensations, while others struggle. There is also a debate about whether describing an experience can ever fully replicate the experience itself. For example, even if someone can describe the experience of schizophrenia or a psychotic break, another person may never truly understand what it feels like without going through it themselves.

The discussion also touches on the idea that some experiences, like echolocation in bats, may be so fundamentally different from human experiences that they might never be fully understandable. This raises the question of whether some subjective experiences are inherently beyond human comprehension or if we simply lack the language to describe them.

### **Philosophical Implications and Further Considerations**

In the final part of the discussion, the lecturer encourages the students to think about the broader implications of these philosophical questions. Can subjective experience ever be fully captured in words? If not, what does that say about our understanding of consciousness and the mind? The lecture concludes with a call to explore the limits of language and knowledge when it comes to inner experiences, and to consider whether there might be better ways to conceptualize or describe them in the future.

The lecture leaves students with more questions than answers, encouraging further reflection on the nature of inner experience and how it relates to our understanding of the self, the mind, and consciousness.
