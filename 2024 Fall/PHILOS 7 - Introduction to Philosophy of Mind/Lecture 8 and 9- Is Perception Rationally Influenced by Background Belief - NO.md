### Introduction to Behavioral Dispositions and Counterexamples

We began this session by discussing some abstract, high-level topics related to behavioral dispositions, specifically focusing on how these dispositions influence our tendencies to act in response to possible effects. A key point addressed here was the counterexamples to the view that mental states are entirely reducible to a set of sophisticated behavioral dispositions. These dispositions influence how we engage with the world and react to stimuli but are not comprehensive explanations of our mental states.

Next, we delved into a challenging philosophical discussion, centered around Daniel Dennett's theory, which is laid out in his notoriously difficult text. In this context, Dennett examines our experiences through a provocative lens, drawing attention to the complexity of mental systems and the diverse array of interpretations published by scholars. We touched upon topics such as classical conditioning, particularly Pavlov’s famous experiment with his dog, and associative learning structures.

### Classical Conditioning and Associative Structures

Pavlov’s work, which many of you are familiar with, remains a cornerstone in discussions of **classical conditioning**. The experiment involving a dog, where a bell was rung to signal the arrival of food, is often cited as evidence of how animals, including humans, can learn through association. This type of learning—where a neutral stimulus becomes associated with a meaningful one—forms the foundation for understanding a broad range of behaviors.

However, there are non-impressive elements in the council of associative learning, especially when considering how beliefs are passively absorbed. People often passively accept propositions without a thorough, critical examination, which stands in contrast to the Cartesian view that every entertained thought must be actively and rationally evaluated. This dichotomy between passive acceptance and active scrutiny of thoughts offers a deeper understanding of how we form beliefs and knowledge structures.

### Cartesian Rationalism and Confirmation Bias

Moving forward, we looked at **confirmation bias**, a well-documented cognitive phenomenon where individuals tend to favor evidence that supports their pre-existing beliefs. This bias does not always manifest but often leads individuals to prefer information that confirms their current worldview, while dismissing or undervaluing evidence that could disprove it. The question then arises: **What constitutes evidence that genuinely disconfirms a belief**?

For example, people tend to give weight to information that supports their opinions and dismiss evidence that challenges them. The implications of this are critical when discussing belief formation and revision. How do we confront evidence that challenges deeply held views? What psychological mechanisms are at play when we selectively acknowledge certain kinds of evidence?

### Belief Extinction and Cognitive Dissonance Theory

Last time, we explored mechanisms related to **belief extinction**—that is, the process by which individuals revise or extinguish beliefs that are no longer tenable. Interestingly, rational arguments alone are often insufficient to cause belief revision. Instead, changes in beliefs tend to occur when individuals experience emotional or psychological conflicts, pushing them toward greater coherence in their worldview.

Cognitive dissonance arises when an individual holds two conflicting beliefs or experiences conflict between their beliefs and actions. For example, someone might say, "That art piece is great," but internally they might find it boring. This emotional conflict, the feeling that one belief or experience is contradicting another, often drives the person to resolve the inconsistency in favor of the belief they already hold or to conform their belief to their actions.

### Deeply Held Beliefs and Polarization

We also considered what happens when individuals confront challenges to **deeply held beliefs**, such as those related to morality, politics, or personal identity. For instance, when confronted with evidence that undermines a core belief (like "my mother is a good person"), people often double down on their original belief rather than adjust it. This can be understood through the lens of **cognitive dissonance theory**, which suggests that when individuals encounter contradictions in their mental frameworks, they may intensify their commitment to their existing beliefs rather than abandon them.

This process helps explain **belief polarization**, where individuals become more entrenched in their views despite contrary evidence. The theory posits that cognitive dissonance, driven by emotional and psychological discomfort, compels individuals to reconcile their beliefs in favor of coherence, even at the cost of rejecting valid counter-evidence.

### Recap and Introduction to Perception

After this recap of cognitive dissonance and belief revision, we transitioned into a new unit on **perception**. In today’s session, we are only beginning our discussion on perception, and we’ll need three sessions to thoroughly cover the material. The focus for this part of the course is the question: **Can perception be rationally influenced by beliefs**? This question ties into the broader psychological and philosophical discussions we’ve been having about the nature of belief and cognitive processes.

Perception is a foundational topic in psychology, and although this course will not be particularly heavy on perception-related content, it’s important that we spend some time unpacking this dense material.

### Overview of Perception: Rational Influence and Belief

Perception, at its core, refers to the way we interpret sensory information from the world around us. A significant question we will address is whether this perceptual process can be **influenced by rational inputs**—specifically, whether our beliefs about the world can alter what we perceive through our senses.

For example, if you're looking at something pink and someone tells you it's green, does that change what you see? Typically, even if you believe the person, your visual perception remains unchanged. This resistance of perception to belief-based influence raises questions about whether perception is truly independent of cognition.

### Defining Perception: Narrow vs. Broad

In everyday language, the word "perception" can refer to both specific sensory experiences (like sight or sound) and broader viewpoints or perspectives (like one’s perception of an issue or a social situation). In this class, however, we’ll use the term **perception** in a narrower, more technical sense, focusing on the **five basic senses**: vision, hearing, smell, taste, and touch.

This includes experiences like visual perception (seeing shapes and colors), auditory perception (hearing sounds and pitches), olfactory perception (smelling different scents), gustatory perception (tasting flavors), and tactile perception (feeling textures and temperatures). We’ll focus on how these basic sensory experiences might be influenced by background beliefs, without extending the discussion to more metaphorical uses of the word "perception."

### Illusions and Hallucinations in Perception

An important distinction to consider when discussing perception is the difference between **illusions** and **hallucinations**. An **illusion** occurs when there is a misrepresentation of reality—when our senses are tricked into perceiving something inaccurately. A common example is the **color illusion**, where two identical colors might look different because of the background they are presented against. In this case, your perception of color is influenced by external factors, but the stimuli themselves are real.

In contrast, a **hallucination** involves perceiving something that doesn’t exist in the real world. For example, when someone hallucinates, they may see objects, people, or things that are not actually present. Hallucinations represent a more profound distortion of perception compared to illusions, as they involve fabrications of sensory experience rather than just a misinterpretation of stimuli.

### The Stability of Perception: Belief vs. Sensory Input

We also touched on the question of **stability in perception**—whether our sensory experiences are subject to change based on our beliefs. Generally, perception is considered stable across different contexts. For example, if you perceive something as pink and someone insists that it is green, your visual experience remains the same. You may intellectually accept the other person's claim, but it doesn’t immediately change what you see.

This apparent stability suggests that **perceptual experiences** might be more resistant to rational influence than other mental states like beliefs, which can be more readily adjusted when confronted with new information.

### Foundationalism and the Role of Perception in Knowledge

To understand why perception is so crucial, we need to look at its role in **epistemology**—the study of knowledge. One of the key theories in epistemology is **foundationalism**, which posits that all of our knowledge is built upon a foundation of basic beliefs, many of which are derived from perception. According to this theory, perceptual experiences provide direct, immediate justification for certain beliefs, and these beliefs form the foundation for more complex knowledge structures.

For foundationalists, perception is a **direct link to reality**, offering unmediated access to the world. If perceptual experiences are found to be influenced by beliefs, this would challenge the notion that perception serves as a reliable foundation for knowledge, raising questions about the independence of perception from cognitive processes like belief formation.

### Can Perception Be Rationally Influenced by Beliefs?

At the core of today’s lecture is the question: **Can beliefs rationally influence perception**? While it is clear that beliefs can influence attention—for instance, if you believe something important is in your environment, you are more likely to focus on it—the debate here centers around whether beliefs can directly affect what we perceive.

The example of the pink object being described as green was discussed to illustrate this point. While you might come to believe that the object is green based on someone's testimony, your visual experience of the object remains unchanged. This suggests that perception is not easily swayed by belief, highlighting its apparent autonomy.

### Studies on Perception and Cognitive Penetrability

Some studies have investigated whether desires, beliefs, or emotional states can influence perception. For instance:

- **Moral reflection**: Some research suggests that reflecting on immoral actions can make the world appear literally darker, not just metaphorically but also in terms of visual perception.
- **Social exclusion**: In experiments where participants felt socially excluded, they often perceived other people as physically closer than they were in reality. This suggests that feelings of loneliness might alter spatial perception.

These findings hint at the possibility that perception is not as independent from cognition as foundationalists might claim. However, the extent and nature of this influence remain subjects of ongoing debate.

### Criticism of the Cognitive Penetrability Hypothesis

Critics of the idea that perception is influenced by beliefs—often referred to as proponents of the **cognitive impenetrability** hypothesis—argue that the studies cited above can be explained through other mechanisms. For example, they point to the role of **attention shifts** in altering perception. When someone feels socially excluded, their heightened awareness of others might explain why people seem closer, rather than any direct influence of loneliness on spatial perception.

Similarly, studies that suggest moral reflection darkens visual perception might be tapping into emotional or physiological responses (e.g., narrowing of the pupils) rather than cognitive influences on the visual system itself.

### Conclusion and Next Steps

In conclusion, today's lecture introduced the complex relationship between **perception and belief**, a topic that bridges philosophy and cognitive psychology. We considered both sides of the debate: on one hand, perception seems to operate independently of belief, as evidenced by its stability in the face of contrary claims. On the other hand, recent studies suggest that desires, emotions, and beliefs may have subtle effects on how we perceive the world.

In the upcoming sessions, we will continue to explore this debate, diving deeper into the evidence supporting both cognitive penetrability and impenetrability. Our goal is to better understand whether perception is truly a window to the world or if it is shaped by our mental states in more profound ways than previously thought.
