**MISSING Critique of Longino**
### Introduction: Revisiting Objectivity in Science

Today’s lecture aims to tackle a fundamental question in the philosophy of science: **what makes a scientific community well-functioning and objective?** We’ve touched on this concept previously, but today, we’ll dig deeper, particularly through the lens of **Helen Longino**, one of the foremost philosophers of science, whose work critically explores how scientific communities can better achieve objectivity. In doing so, we’ll also revisit the example of **Ignaz Semmelweis**, whose failure to convince the 19th-century medical community of his handwashing hypothesis highlights a deeper issue within scientific communities: the role of **social biases**, **methodological criticism**, and how values intertwine with scientific inquiry.

By the end of this discussion, we aim to answer questions about how objectivity can be achieved, why scientific communities sometimes reject good evidence, and how criticism plays a critical role in shaping scientific knowledge. We’ll explore the mechanisms by which communities interact, engage with each other, and either foster or hinder scientific progress. Ultimately, Longino’s work shows us that **objectivity** in science is not just about the individual pursuit of truth but about **collaboration**, **critique**, and the **social fabric** of the scientific process.

But first, let’s return to the case of Semmelweis.

### The Semmelweis Puzzle: What Went Wrong?

The story of **Ignaz Semmelweis** provides a fascinating and tragic case study of how a scientific community can fail to recognize a breakthrough idea. Semmelweis, as many of you will recall, was a Hungarian physician working in Vienna during the mid-19th century. He discovered that by implementing **handwashing** with a chlorine solution, he could dramatically reduce the incidence of **puerperal fever** (childbed fever) in maternity wards. Yet, despite his compelling evidence, the **medical community** of his time rejected his hypothesis.

Semmelweis’ ideas were met with **hostility**, skepticism, and dismissal. Some historians suggest this was due to **social biases**—Semmelweis was an outsider, both ethnically (Hungarian in an Austrian-dominated environment) and professionally (he held a relatively low position in the hospital hierarchy). Others point to his **arrogant personality** and combative style of presentation, which alienated his peers. And, as we’ve discussed before, his hypothesis was also threatening to the medical establishment because it implied that **doctors themselves were responsible** for spreading deadly infections.

This leads us to a set of critical questions: **Was the medical community of the 1840s well-functioning? Was their rejection of Semmelweis an example of a malfunctioning scientific community, or were they following reasonable standards based on the evidence available at the time?** These questions go to the heart of what we mean when we talk about objectivity and well-functioning communities in science. And this is where the philosophical frameworks provided by **Gillies**, **Toulmin**, and most notably, **Helen Longino** come into play.

### Defining a Well-Functioning Scientific Community

Philosophers like **Gillies** and **Toulmin** have attempted to define the characteristics of a well-functioning scientific community. **Gillies**, for instance, argues that a well-functioning scientific community should adhere to three critical principles when evaluating hypotheses:

1. **No Reputation-Based Rejections**: A community should not reject a hypothesis simply because it threatens the reputation of its members. For example, Semmelweis’ hypothesis suggested that doctors, through unclean practices, were causing infections. Rejecting his idea to protect their reputation would undermine the integrity of the scientific process.
    
2. **Substance Over Style**: The rejection of a hypothesis should not be based on the **style** or **personality** of the individual presenting it. While Semmelweis may have been long-winded, arrogant, or overly critical of his peers, these personality traits should not have been grounds for dismissing his hypothesis. What mattered was the **substance** of his claim, not how he delivered it.
    
3. **No Social Bias**: A community should not reject hypotheses based on the **social status**, **ethnicity**, or **background** of the person proposing them. Semmelweis, as a Hungarian working in the Austrian medical establishment, may have faced ethnic prejudice, which likely contributed to the rejection of his ideas. Gillies emphasizes that scientific communities must guard against such biases to ensure that ideas are evaluated on their merits.
    

While these principles provide a good starting point for understanding what might constitute a well-functioning scientific community, they leave some questions unanswered. How do we ensure that criticism within the community is constructive and productive? What makes certain criticisms legitimate, and how do social values shape the scientific process? This is where **Helen Longino’s work** becomes particularly valuable.

### Longino’s Framework for Objectivity in Science

**Helen Longino** offers a more nuanced and socially embedded understanding of scientific objectivity. For Longino, **science is a fundamentally social activity**. Scientific objectivity is not merely about applying the right methods or following the right logical steps—it is about how a **community** of scientists interacts, communicates, and engages in critical debate. According to Longino, a well-functioning scientific community must satisfy the following four criteria:

1. **Recognized Avenues for Criticism**: A scientific community must have formalized ways for members to **critique** one another’s work. Peer review is the most obvious example of this, but criticism can also take place through public debates at conferences, responses in academic journals, or even informal discussions. The key is that criticism must be **encouraged** and **institutionalized**. Without these avenues, bad science can go unchecked, and new ideas—like Semmelweis’ handwashing hypothesis—can be stifled.
    
2. **Shared Standards of Evaluation**: For criticism to be effective, there must be **shared standards** by which scientific claims are judged. These standards can include **empirical adequacy** (the hypothesis must fit the data), **explanatory power** (the ability of the hypothesis to explain phenomena), and **consistency** (the hypothesis must not contradict well-established facts). Without these shared standards, a community could descend into **subjectivity** and **relativism**, where each person evaluates hypotheses based on personal preferences or idiosyncratic beliefs.
    
3. **Responsiveness to Criticism**: It is not enough for criticism to be aired—scientific communities must also be **responsive** to criticism. This means that when someone raises a legitimate critique, the community must engage with it seriously. For example, if Semmelweis’ colleagues had responded to his evidence with constructive feedback rather than outright dismissal, they might have uncovered additional supporting data for his hypothesis. The failure to respond to legitimate criticism indicates a **closed** or **dogmatic** community.
    
4. **Equality in Intellectual Authority**: A well-functioning scientific community must ensure that **intellectual authority** is shared equally among its members, regardless of their social status, ethnicity, or gender. This is one of Longino’s most important contributions, as she highlights how **social hierarchies** within scientific communities can distort the process of inquiry. If certain voices are marginalized—whether because of race, gender, or institutional prestige—then the community is likely to overlook important insights.
    

These four criteria form the foundation of Longino’s view of a **well-structured scientific community**, and they stand in contrast to simpler models of scientific objectivity that focus solely on the methods used or the data gathered. For Longino, **science is a collaborative endeavor**, and objectivity emerges not from isolated individuals applying rigid methods, but from the **interactions** between members of a community who are committed to **open criticism**, **shared standards**, and **equality**.

### Peer Review and Other Avenues of Criticism

Let’s delve into Longino’s first criterion—**recognized avenues of criticism**—by exploring how scientific communities institutionalize criticism through mechanisms like **peer review**. The peer review process, as you know, is one of the most established ways in which scientists critique one another’s work. When a scientist submits a paper to a journal, it is sent to several other scientists (the "peers") who evaluate the quality of the research, the soundness of the methods, and the validity of the conclusions.

However, criticism can also occur in more **informal settings**, such as **academic conferences**, where scientists present their findings and engage in live debates. The critical exchange that occurs at these events is crucial for refining ideas, identifying flaws, and generating new hypotheses.

Let’s consider a historical example that shows the importance of **responsiveness** to criticism: **Charles Darwin** and **Lord Kelvin**. Lord Kelvin, one of the most respected physicists of his time, challenged Darwin’s theory of evolution by natural selection on the grounds that the Earth was **not old enough** to support the slow processes of natural selection. Kelvin’s calculations, based on his understanding of thermodynamics, suggested that the Earth could only be a few million years old—far too young for the gradual evolution of species.

Kelvin’s critique forced Darwin and his supporters to re-examine their assumptions. In fact, **Darwin** became so concerned about Kelvin’s objections that he began to explore other mechanisms, like **sexual selection**, that could work more quickly than natural selection. This is a perfect example of a scientific community being **responsive to criticism**—Darwin’s ideas were not rejected outright, but they were **challenged** in a way that pushed the theory forward.

Ultimately, Kelvin’s critique turned out to be based on faulty assumptions about the Earth’s composition, but it was taken seriously and addressed, demonstrating the value of **constructive criticism** in scientific progress.

### The Importance of Shared Standards

The second of Longino’s criteria—**shared standards of evaluation**—is vital for maintaining consistency and coherence within a scientific community. For criticism to be meaningful, there must be **agreed-upon criteria** that everyone uses to judge the validity of a claim. These criteria often include **empirical adequacy**, meaning the hypothesis must **fit the data**, as well as **explanatory power**, meaning the hypothesis must explain more than its competitors.

But as Longino points out, **shared standards** can sometimes be problematic. While shared standards ensure consistency, they can also be used to **enforce conformity** and **exclude** novel ideas. For example, a community might place too much emphasis on **simplicity**—the idea that the best explanation is the simplest one. While simplicity can be a valuable heuristic, it can also lead to **oversimplification**. A complex phenomenon might require a complex explanation, and a community overly committed to simplicity might reject such an explanation even if it’s correct.

This is why Longino stresses that **shared standards** must be **epistemically valid**—they must promote the search for truth, rather than merely reflecting the **social or cultural biases** of the community. For instance, the rejection of Semmelweis’ hypothesis might partly be explained by a shared standard in the medical community that emphasized **theories of humoral imbalance**, which were dominant at the time. Semmelweis’ germ theory-based approach conflicted with these prevailing standards, which made it harder for his ideas to gain traction.

### Social Bias and the Role of Diversity in Science

One of Longino’s most significant contributions to the philosophy of science is her argument that **social diversity** within scientific communities is essential for **objectivity**. A community that is homogeneous in terms of **gender**, **race**, or **social background** is more likely to overlook certain kinds of evidence or fail to question its own **assumptions**. By contrast, a **diverse community** brings different perspectives and experiences to the table, which helps to **broaden the scope of inquiry** and **challenge entrenched biases**.

This brings us back to Semmelweis. One reason his ideas may have been dismissed is because he was a **Hungarian** working in the Austrian medical establishment. His status as an outsider—both ethnically and professionally—may have made it easier for his colleagues to dismiss his findings. If the medical community of the time had been more **inclusive** and **diverse**, it’s possible that Semmelweis’ ideas would have been given more serious consideration.

Longino argues that **diversity** is not just a matter of fairness—it is a **scientific necessity**. A community that includes people from different social backgrounds is less likely to fall into the trap of **groupthink** and more likely to **critique** its own assumptions. For example, feminist scholars have pointed out how **gender biases** have shaped research in fields like **medicine** and **psychology**. By bringing attention to these biases, feminist scholars have helped to make science more objective.

### The Social Nature of Science

One of Longino’s key insights is that **science is a fundamentally social activity**. This contrasts sharply with traditional views of science, which often emphasize the **individual** scientist working in isolation. Longino argues that **objectivity** cannot be achieved by isolated individuals, no matter how rational or methodologically rigorous they are. Instead, objectivity is something that emerges through the **interaction** of scientists within a **community**.

For example, a lone scientist may be highly critical of their own work, but without the **input** and **feedback** of others, they may fail to recognize certain biases or blind spots. This is why **public criticism** is so essential to scientific progress. It is only through the **public exchange of ideas** that science can be truly objective.

### Conclusion: Toward a More Objective and Inclusive Science

In conclusion, **Helen Longino’s framework** for understanding scientific objectivity offers a more **inclusive** and **nuanced** approach than traditional models. She shows us that scientific objectivity is not just about applying the right methods or gathering the right data—it is about creating a **community** that fosters **criticism**, **collaboration**, and **equality**. Longino’s criteria for a well-functioning scientific community—**recognized avenues for criticism**, **shared standards**, **responsiveness to criticism**, and **equality in intellectual authority**—offer a blueprint for how science can become more **objective** and **progressive**.

By focusing on the **social dimensions of knowledge**, Longino reminds us that science is not just about discovering facts but about **engaging** with others in a **shared pursuit of truth**. To achieve this, scientific communities must be **open**, **diverse**, and **self-critical**. Only then can they truly be considered well-functioning.

In the case of **Semmelweis**, we see what happens when these criteria are not met. His hypothesis was rejected not because it was scientifically unsound, but because the medical community of his time failed to meet the standards of a well-functioning scientific community. By understanding the dynamics at play in cases like this, we can work toward creating **better** scientific communities in the future—ones that are not only more **inclusive** but also more **effective** in the pursuit of knowledge.
