Logic is the study of reasoning. Reasoning involves thinking, and thinking itself is difficult to study. Therefore, contemporary logic studies thought manifested: arguments. 

An argument is a series of premises which are intended to lead to a conclusion.  

Sentences are not propositions, they involve context about the speaker, audience, and language itself. Therefore, logicians freeze context, and sentences are written under the assumption that they are propositions.

There's a distinction between the experience of logic and the technicality of logic

Sound arguments need true premises and valid reasoning. Truth is out of scope for the logician. 

As for validity:

In the classical tradition, validity means that there is no possibility for the conclusion to be false if the premises are true. In other words, there is no counterexample. In this context possibility just means that it can be logically conceived. 

Is being sound enough, or does an argument also be relevant to be considered a "good argument"?
