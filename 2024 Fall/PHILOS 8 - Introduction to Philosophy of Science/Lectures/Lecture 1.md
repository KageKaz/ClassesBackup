Not the things that we do. So, I suppose it's my job to tell you why philosophy of science might be important. And why don't we just start by asking you all why the philosophy of science might be important? Sure, you can check off a general education requirement or other practical things like that, but give me an answer that’s going to make me feel good about my job.

He's feeling great. Ah, the first great student. Your name is Armand? Okay, excellent. What do you think? Science explains the world that we live in. Okay, and so why do we philosophize on top of what science is doing? Yeah, yeah. So, if I can generalize that a little bit, because this may be a complementary but different perspective than the one provided by—what’s your name?

Yeah, sorry. It's about reflecting on science—a second-order kind of thing. Great. Yeah, great. My name is Bebe. Adding on to what Armand said, I think philosophy also gives us a more critical framework to examine the science we consume because you should have the tools to think critically about the knowledge that’s being provided to you.

Good, good. I like this—this is such a nice yes-and move here. So, Armand is like, “It provides us with a different perspective,” and Alana adds, “Oh, it’s a more reflective perspective.” And you, Bebe, are like, “Yes, it’s a more critical reflective perspective.” Awesome.

A lot of good ideas here. I'm going to let Bebe win this round if that's okay with everyone, because I’m sure you all have great ideas, but this is a really nice segue to how I want to structure the class throughout.

One thing I'm going to focus on in this class, and I'll give probably a couple of different streams and analogies here in a second, is about figuring out when we have good evidence for a hypothesis. You'll see there are different ways of thinking about this, which are personally tied to logic and good reasoning, and that will be the core focus. So, here’s my first analogy, and if it doesn’t work, we’ll try another one. This is going to be the hull of the cruise liner that is the course, and what will be kind of nice is that we’ll make exotic stops along the way.

While studying different forms of scientific reasoning and different ways evidence can support a hypothesis, we’ll also explore what might seem like more obviously philosophical questions, such as: How do scientific communities need to be structured to produce knowledge? And how do we know we have to believe that knowledge? Another question we'll look at is: What are some of the ways explanatory and ontological considerations tell us something about race and social structures? And finally, what are some of the proper roles for social models or theories? These are some of the stops we’ll make on our cruise, but the hull is made up of thinking about evidence and reasoning. Good.

So, let’s get into a few practical details. For those of you who know this, we’ll get more into it soon. Part of your homework is to actually learn a little bit more about the course policies and such. The first thing I want to do is introduce you to your TAs. So, if everyone could just stand up, that would be great. We have Javi over here, Nadia, and then the trio of doom over there: Samantha, James, and Juania. Oh, and Joyce, except—oh, there you are! Okay, I didn’t see you. Your hair has changed color since last night, but anyway…

These are your TAs, and they are all wonderful from everything I’ve seen. They’re eager to prove me wrong, but I won’t let them! There’s one thing you might have picked up on already, especially if you’ve reached out to me early, which is that I want you to use them as your first line of defense. This isn’t because I don’t want to talk to you, but there are 300 of you, and if I’m accountable to all 300 of you, I will never be able to give anyone a thoughtful email response.

Please go through your TA. If it really needs to come to me, then I will handle it. You can always talk to me after class or during office hours. I just want you all to be treated well. If you ask me something directly and I’m overwhelmed, I might just send a generic “sounds good,” which isn’t helpful.

Go to your discussion section and make sure that’s going well. Another thing I want to flag is—this is embarrassing—but for two quarters in a row, I somehow managed to schedule something on the second class of the quarter. So, I won’t be here for the second class, and on top of that, my office hours are impacted. There are no office hours for me on Wednesday, which is usually when they’re held from 2-4 PM. The good news for you is that you don’t have to come to class on Wednesday.

However, you do have some homework: look at the course’s learning objectives, grading policies, and other logistical details. One thing you should know is that you’re evaluated almost entirely based on quizzes, which will be held on Canvas. You’ll have about three days to complete each one, and they should take around 30 minutes if you’ve kept up with the readings and lectures. They’re graded automatically, which makes things easier for everyone.

Your first quiz will be posted this Friday. It’ll cover course policies and what we’ve covered in class today. Any questions about the logistics? I don't want to spend too much time on this, but I'll give you maybe five minutes.

On UCLA’s website, it says there’s a final exam, but don’t worry—there’s no final. The quizzes will make up most of your grade, and the details are in your homework. Excellent! Please have the reading done for today and come in with questions. The same goes for the rest of the course—stay engaged, and that will enrich the classroom experience.

Now, as a general aspiration, I don’t want to fall into the trap of just talking non-stop for an hour and 15 minutes, because that becomes contagious and boring. I want you to feel comfortable asking questions, even if it’s something like, “I don’t understand what’s going on on page six.” Almost invariably, it’ll be a good question, and I’ll never tell you it’s a bad question.

You had a question? Oh, sorry, Leslie—there’s nothing to complete on the handouts. The handouts are just detailed notes on the reading, essentially a textual analog to the PowerPoint. You’re welcome to read them beforehand, in real time, or afterward—whatever works best for you.

Any other questions? Sorry, the projector is beaming straight into my eyes, so if you’re sitting toward the back, you might need to do something dramatic for me to see you. Yes, you—what’s your name?

Are we taking people off the waitlist? Okay, the story behind this is that my chief concern is to make sure there’s an equitable distribution amongst the TAs. It’s ultimately up to the TAs whether they want to add you to the course. So, for those of you on the waitlist, figure out what section you’re in and who your TA is, then reach out to them. If they’re willing to add you, I’ll give them a PTE code.

Other questions? Yes, over there—your name?

Good question. Here’s a more concrete way of answering: you’ll be quizzed on anything from the readings, the handouts, the PowerPoint, or anything I discuss in lectures. So, all of that is fair game.

Are the quizzes open-note? Yes, because they’re on Canvas, you can even be sitting at a frat party with your notes if you want to be the coolest person there! The quizzes aren’t timed in the traditional sense. You have about three days to complete them, and they typically take 30 minutes.

There are four total participation points. Two of those are determined by your TA, and two are determined by me. If our interactions are mostly about asking philosophical questions, you’ll get all two points. But if our interactions are mostly about you nagging me for a higher grade without much basis, you won’t get any points.

Let’s talk about validity and argumentation now. The backbone of this course is figuring out when evidence supports a hypothesis. You can see this as a more specific version of a general puzzle: when is one thing a good reason for another? For example, when evidence supports a hypothesis, it’s a good reason to accept it. We don’t always talk about reasons and evidence in the same way, but we’ll get familiar with terms used for discussing reasoning more generally.

The author of the textbook we’re using is John Holt. He’s retired from the University of Tennessee and has a wide range of interests, including environmental ethics, intergenerational ethics, formal modeling of value theory, and philosophical logic.

So, let's talk about why this matters. The central question of this course is, what counts as good reasoning? In a more concrete sense, this relates to how evidence supports a hypothesis. We need to familiarize ourselves with terms useful for talking about reasoning more generally and focus on the simplest, most fundamental form of reasoning—deductively valid reasoning.

Some of these terms have more colloquial analogs, but we’re going to use them in a more specific and technical way. So, rely on your intuition, but recognize that these are technical terms.

This really matters because we want to be critical of the arguments we encounter. In this course, we’ll focus on reasoning and evidence, which I think are essential in any introductory course. To be critical of an

But evidence of the species and premises, similarly, insofar as hypotheses are affirmed on the basis of premises, hypotheses are a species. Good. Any other questions about this? Everyone's gonna give another term. What’s your name? Oh, Valerie. Valerie, yeah. Well, from my understanding, premises make up an argument, like opposition and document.

Okay, so each premise expresses a proposition, and the conclusion expresses a proposition. An argument is going to be a set of declarative sentences, and propositions are pretty much interchangeable for the purposes of this class. In philosophical language, you might hear me say that, but yeah, for all we care, they're basically the same thing. Everyone knows what a declarative sentence is?

Yes? Okay, awesome. Those are bad arguments, right? Uh, there are a few cases where they're actually valid arguments, but once again, I’m very annoyed that I don’t have a chalkboard. Let me just give you—here’s a very weird argument that's actually valid. This sort of gives you a spoiler alert.

I’ll use some abstract words.

Alright, so suppose I say something like, "Avi is a Clippers fan. Bobby is not a beautiful channel. Therefore, all toads are..." So, this is technically a valid argument, right? Uh, but obviously, there’s no relevance here. We can talk about why that’s valid in a little bit. Remind me to go back to Avi and toads and snakes when we talk about the relationship between validity and relevance. So suppose I just said, "Avi is a Clippers fan. Therefore, all toads are snakes."

That’s invalid, and obviously, the conclusion doesn’t follow from the premises, right? That one’s a little less interesting. The other one’s more interesting, but also weird. Anyway, that’s like boutique-level stuff for the purposes of this class, just so you know. But a good thing to notice in the reading is that they’re both part of an argument, and each of them is a proposition, which is in line with what...sorry, what’s your name? Valerie. Other questions? Okay, great.

I just want to say great job for being active in class. Keep it up. Don’t fade. You’ve got nine more weeks to go after this one.

Okay.

So, just to test ourselves, we have our definition of an argument down. Let me give you two examples, and can you tell me whether they’re arguments or not? The first example: "String theory says that all aspects of our universe, the particles that make up matter, and the forces that act on those particles consist of tiny strings of energy."

Is this an argument? Is there a conclusion being confirmed on the basis of premises? Yes, you’re shaking your head emphatically. I like that. What’s your name? No, the person behind you. Yes, you. Why did you say no?

Yeah, right. There’s basically only one sentence here, right? It’s just, "This is what string theory says," and that’s it. So, there’s nothing being affirmed on the basis of anything else. Did everyone see that?

There are conspiracy theories, for example. There are bad theories, which are just sort of dreamed up. Like, I could probably come up with a weird theory right now that you are a robot being operated by little invisible men or something like that. That’s a theory, but it’s a garbage theory. I have no evidence for it. I’m not affirming it under any kind of logic. Sylvia? I think what Sylvia was pointing to is that a theory, when done right, our best theories are almost invariably affirmed on the basis of evidence, right? There’s no avoiding that.

There are some interesting challenges, though we won’t get into them, about string theory and whether it can do that too. But do you see that? That’s for advanced thinkers. This is just an intro class.

Now, let’s contrast that with this example, just in case people aren’t feeling entirely comfortable with recognizing why that wasn’t an argument. Let’s contrast it with this example, and I’ll tell you upfront that this is an argument: "A theory is scientific only if it is empirically testable. String theory is not empirically testable. Therefore, string theory is not a scientific theory."

This is a complaint that some physicists have about string theory.

Alright, so everyone, what makes this an argument? How do we know it’s an argument? What tips us off? There’s a conclusion, right? You, with the multicolored shirt—there’s multiple declarative sentences, and the last one is the conclusion, which is true if the first two are true.

Yes, good. I’m sorry, what’s your name? Ethan. So, you’re right—there’s clearly a set of declarative sentences here, and it’s pretty clear that one statement is being affirmed on the basis of the others. There’s actually something very clear in this argument that I’ll talk about in a slide or two, something that advertises that this is an argument. Can anyone tell me which word it is? You, in the corner, with glasses.

Yes, Ian, right. This word right here: "therefore." We’ll talk more about that in a second.

Alright, from Ethan, Ian, and…what was your name again? Sorry, I’m testing myself here. I’m not going to remember any of your names by next week, by the way, so I apologize in advance.

So, I take it you can kind of see there’s a pattern of reasoning here that feels familiar, right? We’ll talk more about that soon. But you can imagine that if you blocked out that last sentence, it would feel pretty natural to just add it in. Does anyone else feel that way? It’s okay if you don’t, but often people have this intuition. It becomes harder to see that it’s an argument, but I think it still is.

This just sort of signals to you—if you removed that last sentence or the word "therefore"—you might still have the momentum, that intuition, that it’s implied. You can imagine someone saying, "A theory is scientific only if it is empirically testable, and string theory is not," and that implies that string theory isn’t really a scientific theory.

But, that takes a little bit of conversational context to make that implication pop. What we’re trying to do in this class is make arguments explicit, so we don’t have to work as hard to figure out what’s going on. That’s what makes philosophers seem odd at cocktail parties: we insist on making things explicit.

Uh, I mean, what makes me nervous about this is there are so many ways of telling a story, and some of them work better for this, and some of them don’t. So, I would say, if it’s a fairly straightforward story, like, uh, you know, um, uh, don’t think of post-modern stories or something like that as your model. But if it’s just like, uh, oh, you know, like this thing happened, and then this thing happened, and, uh, you can kind of see how it all comes together, then you have to be careful. Even there, you have to be careful because temporal sequences sometimes feel like arguments, but they’re not. Uh, so, if I told you, “I woke up this morning, I made coffee, I ate breakfast, I brushed my teeth, I shaved, etc.,” you know, I could even put in, “and so after that, I went to the bus,” you know.

That’s not an argument. That’s just a sequence of events, so that’s the story structure. Uh, it is right that the way that we found narratives are structured around sequences. I would just be very careful about drawing quick inferences one way or the other. Some arguments don’t really lend themselves to a narrative quality, and some narratives, if they’re trying to affirm something on the basis of something else, like, we don’t always do that. I might have just wanted to tell you how my morning went, maybe because I’m making small talk and I’m not trying to engage in serious reasoning. You’ve had your hand up for a second.

Yeah, holding premises to be true, like, all the premises, and make the argument, oh, we’re going to talk about this. But, um, the short story for now is there’s a distinction between sound arguments and valid arguments, and that tries to capture it back with this.

Yeah, I think this is, uh, sort of akin to a question asked before. You don’t technically—like, there are lots of conversations where it’s obvious that if you assert these two things and then assert this thing without it, you’re making an argument. I suppose there might be some context where you’re not doing that.

Um, but once again, we’re going to try to keep the conversational guesswork to a minimum and just really try to focus on when something is a good reason for something else. So, we’re going to try to minimize that to some extent, but it’s important to keep these things in mind just because, um, here’s a good lesson to learn from this: If you want to make your reasoning clear, it’s probably a good idea to pop in a “so,” just so people know when you’re actually affirming something on the basis of something else, okay? And that’s a kind of skill I just want you to take from this class. It’s something that a lot of you guys probably do by default, so that you’re a little bit more self-conscious about it. I think I became a much better writer after teaching logic, basically talking about this. That’s my hope.

Okay, so we’ve talked a little bit about “so,” and there’s a whole bunch of markers in ordinary language that we use to advertise that something is either a premise or a conclusion. These are called premise and conclusion indicators, and they’re useful both when you’re reading a text, to figure out what’s from itself is implied, and they’re also really useful when you’re writing, for exactly the reasons I mentioned before. If you want to communicate your reasoning as clearly as possible in plain English, it’s a good idea.

Let me give you a long list of each, right? I should say these routinely or often signal that something is a conclusion or a premise, but they’re not foolproof. So, since we know, sometimes, “since” just denotes time, right? So, if I say, “Since I moved to Los Angeles, I caught a dozen concerts,” right? I’m not making an argument, right? Uh, but there are other cases where we’ll get “since” in a different context too, so I’ll get into that. Well, here are some other ones. This is not an exhaustive list, either. These are just some paradigmatic ones as indicated by “because,” “for,” “in that,” “as may be inferred from,” which is a little weird—I don’t think anyone actually talks that way, but maybe I’m wrong—“given that,” “seeing that,” “for the reason that,” “inasmuch as,” “owing to,” etc.

So, those basically—let’s look at them—but let’s just give a clear-cut case of those. So, if I said, “Since string theory isn’t empirically testable, it’s not a scientific theory,” that would be me using “since” as a premise indicator, right? And you see that what immediately follows that is a premise: “String theory isn’t empirically testable,” right? And then there’s a sort of comma, and what immediately follows after that is a conclusion.

Here are a bunch of indicators we use, as we saw in the previous slide, when something is a conclusion, right? “Therefore,” “accordingly,” “we may conclude,” “hence,” “thus,” “consequently,” “we may infer,” “it must be that,” “so,” “it follows that,” “as a result,” etc. And, um, someone already mentioned the three dots. We’ll often just use this as a quick way of flagging a conclusion of our arguments. Any questions about this? So everyone basically understands that when we see these, you should assume that what immediately follows it is going to be a premise. You can see these positive devices.

Yes, where do those three dots come from? Uh, that’s a good question. Um, I don’t know. When one dot loves another dot, uh, I—I don’t know the exact origin of this. Does anyone know the exact origin? Uh, it’s used in mathematics in that way? Okay, so let’s give ourselves an example, right?

Um, so, uh, what’s the indicator here? Good. All right, we didn’t forget anything from the last slide. Is that a premise or a conclusion? Uh, and so, all right, we might reconstruct it this way. You’ll often see me sort of doing premise-conclusion reconstructions. Great. Premise one: “Chicago is north of Boston.” Everyone sees that the sentence says, “Hey, we’re not done spelling out our premises,” so the next premise is “Boston is north of Charleston,” right? And then we throw in the three dots in indicators, right? Uh, the conclusion: “Chicago is north of Charleston.” Right. So this is a rather, uh, explicit way of making the reasoning clear, of showing what the reasoning is. We know exactly what the premises are and exactly what the conclusion is.

Good. All right. And so, one thing you might get tested on in your quiz is having a passage where you have to spot premise or conclusion indicators and tell me which one is which, okay?

So, um, sort of working in the background of all this is a notion of truth, right? So, it sounds like it’s going to be deep and philosophical—actually, it’s shallow and philosophical, as much as it can be—so, apologies for that. Hey, um, so, if you look at this account, or this definition of an argument, there’s nothing about it that really says anything about truth.

Here’s another way of basically saying the same thing, right? In an argument, the premises are reasons to take the conclusion to be true. So just think about our little example of Chicago and Boston and Charleston, right? The premises basically give us reason to think that it’s true, right? That Chicago is north of Charleston.

So here’s a big philosophical question. As I said, right? What does it mean for a sentence to be true? And what I’m going to give you is not much of a theory of truth, right? It basically says a sentence is true if and only if the world is as the sentence describes. Here’s a slightly different way of putting it, and let’s—we’re going to have to start getting comfortable with this sort of convention, which we’ll do a lot. So we’re just going to sort of have a placeholder for any old sentence that we want with a variable, and, uh, we’ll sort of indicate that something is a sentence when it’s in quotes. So what we’re saying is, a declarative sentence P is true if and only if P.

Right. So, this doesn’t seem like it’s saying very much. Let’s just give you a couple examples, and you’ll see it does, right? The sentence “dogs are mammals” is true if and only if dogs are mammals, right? Everyone sees, basically, the sentence is true if the world is as the sentence describes it, right?

Um, the sentence “leprechauns exist” is true if and only if leprechauns exist, right? This one’s a little bit trickier, but hopefully, you guys see, right? This isn’t saying leprechauns exist; it’s saying, if the sentence were true, right, leprechauns would exist. And if leprechauns exist, then the sentence is true, right?

But it’s not saying anything about whether leprechauns actually exist. We know that the sentence is false. Yes?

I remember when we were going over statements like that, I remember we abbreviated “if and only if” as “iff.” Can we do that as well?

Uh, sure. Uh

So what you're talking about? Like something that's a contradiction. Ah, okay, good. Yeah, so someone asked this question earlier. We're at the point where we can't do it. Give me just a little bit more time, and I'll get to it. I just want to make sure we've got the idea of "politically without sound."

Um, all right, so, but everyone sees that the second terminal is false, right? Uh, did you have a question? Is it something I can manipulate? Uh, so maybe I'm not understanding the question.

Yes, it's possible to have. I mean, look at, uh, nothing which says all the premises are true, right? That's really the first condition. This just says if all the premises are true, but obviously whenever I say, "If anything D," that's no guarantee that is true, right? So, if I say, "If there's a fire, you should run for the exits," I'm not saying there's a fire, right?

I'm saying if there is one, that's a good thing to do, right? When I say, "If all the premises are true, then the conclusion must be true," then it looks like I'm not claiming all the premises are true. But what I wanted to sort of hammer home is, look, if I did the same sort of moving of the circles that I did with the previous one, you would end up with exactly the same problem, right?

Where if I say, "Move the orange circle outside the yellow circle," the first premise would be false, right? So there'd be no way that conclusion could be true, and all these are going to do. It's still a valid argument. Uh, yeah. Yeah, I forgot your name.

Ah, okay. Okay. Fair enough. Um, uh, this is just an easy way of representing that. Yeah, I could note that if I made this just all wolves or mammals, I have exactly the representation you're talking about. Yeah. Um, I've been varying that a little bit more too. Um, in fact, if you remember that one model I had where it was scrambling, it's basically a way of... For Africa, I could just put Khalifa in the intersection of the two, and I would think

It'll work just like that. The previous one did the same thing here all? Yeah, exactly. Maybe that's a better way to do it. Uh, okay. Uh, yeah, so you have like more subjective truths that are only true for you and your reality or their own realities, and that's still, you know, those truths to them.

Still be valid or sound. Yeah, those get electric there. So suppose I said something like, uh, if vanilla ice cream is the best ice cream, then uh, I should uh, order it for dessert, right? Uh, vanilla ice cream is the best ice cream. Therefore, I order it. That's still going to be valid, right?

But we don't really know whether it's all right, so that would be the challenge. Detective, and just know you're talking about like when I say vanilla is saying something about myself and not about, you know, deliciousness 375 years old? So objectives. And well, at least with the idea that sometimes this happens in science, when we look at commons,

Oh, okay. Um, maybe it's a very tricky word in, uh, if you don't mind, I'm just going to say like that's above the pay grade in this particular person, but we could talk about it outside, of course. Before I forget to go back to this weird argument we had with Javi being both a position and not a perfect thing.

Who's the one who originally caught me with that question? I remember. Okay. Well, whoever you are. Okay. So note you can now see why this argument is valid, but not that, right? Um, so a valid argument is one in which there's no possible situation in which all the premises are true and the conclusion is false. Guess what? There's no possible situation in which all the premises are true. Everyone sees that. So there's no possible situation where all the premises are true. And so, that's why this weird sentence, this weird argument is valid, right? It's sort of on a technicality, right?

But everyone can see it shouldn't bother us too much because it's impossible for it to be false.

Uh, that's the idea. Note, we don't have that problem here. Because it's possible that Javi came to his senses in the last half hour. Okay. Uh, so yeah, okay. But that's like, as I said, it's sort of a boutique aspect of things if you're really interested in these things.

By the way, uh, I really strongly encourage you to take an introduction to logic. My own view about this is the two classes that everyone should take as undergraduates are introduction to logic and statistics, but, uh, you don't have to listen to me about that. And if you're not going to take statistics, this is like a pale imposter.

Um, everybody's feeling good about this, being an invalid, but

Okay. What's changing for this example? You want to make it "Wolver Mammal"? Because it won't change. So that's going to feel a little bit.

All right, let's talk about counterexamples. So, um, an invalid argument is one in which there's at least one possible situation in which all the premises are true and the conclusion is false. Uh, and so a counterexample is just basically one of those situations.

That's really obvious to it with a little added wrinkle. Talk about that in a second. Now, for the purposes of this course, I think just sort of training yourself to become better at constructing counterexamples, right? One of these things where, actually, once you get sort of comfy with it, it's sort of part of an act of insight and intuition and creativity.

So it's kind of fun to do. Probably laugh once again. Why no one likes philosophy that I packed up.

So, um, here's just a crucial thing to keep in mind, although it's a really important skill for constructing a counterexample, right? It sort of shows you how things that are being offered as premises might not sort of seal the deal in terms of securing the conclusion. Can't construct the counterexample.

Uh, sadly you might say more about you than enough yard, right? Uh, be that it's not a valid argument. It might be that you just don't sort of kick the tires on the argument the right sorts of ways. Uh, one thing that we'll do towards the end of this, time permitting, is not on a handout, is I'll give you a bunch of very common argument patterns that are both valid and invalid, and that's just sort of helping you sort of train yourself up in terms of good arguments and better reasoning.

So, uh, sticking with pandas, uh, suppose we had to follow, right? If giant pandas are members of the raccoon family, then they descended from, uh, they didn't descend from Christian today, right? And so, what follows for that?

Okay, so is that valid or invalid?

Okay. It's out. All right. Uh, and basically, we would run a very similar sort of counter model with this particular circle group. Let's look at the actions here to this one. So, um, one thing I want to flag—we'll do this in a bit. Let's go through this example just so we see what million dollars. But, um, here's an obvious one, I hope. Uh, there's giant pandas are members of the raccoon family; therefore, they are mammals. Giant pandas are mammals; therefore, they are crew members of direct engineering. Everything will figure this validation. Valid I should say this actually so invalid.

Yeah. So you already have thought about what the counterexample looks like for this. He thinks that they want to take a stab at it. Um, that they could have is a different group of animals. Perfect. Yes, exactly, right. So, um, one way to think about this, I'm sorry, right?

So Ty was basically pointing out that there are lots of different ways to be a mammal, right? A raccoon is not the royal route. You're being a male, right? One way to think the only way to do it. This is invalid. You can see that if it was something like, so they might be mammals, diverging from being in some other family.

No, no, this one. This is one of the things that's tricky about. This one's like we know, right? We now know, pandas are bears, so that makes it easy, but I will actually get to that, right? Um, in this case, the premises are true, right? But the conclusion is false, right?

There's some possible situation. Exactly. Um, now, crucially, um, I think the last premise is a little bit hard to sort of see why it still remains true. But note that, um, it's perfectly consistent with the idea that, um, if giant pandas are members of the raccoon family, right? Then they're mammals, right?

Once again, remember if anything doesn't commit you to discrete either parts of that, right? You do the thing that immediately follows the effort within that individual. So would this still be here? But we're going to still be invalid if you have giant pandas really were members of the acting thing.
