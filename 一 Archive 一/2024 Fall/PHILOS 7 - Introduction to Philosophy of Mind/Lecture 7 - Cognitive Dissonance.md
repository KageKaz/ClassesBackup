# Introduction to Inner Experience

Welcome to today's lecture. We’re going to delve into an intriguing yet challenging philosophical concept: inner experience. The question of whether or not we can truly access or understand our inner experiences has long been debated. It’s a difficult topic because “inner experience” isn’t something tangible—it’s deeply subjective. However, philosophy has been tasked with exploring such elusive concepts, and today, we’ll attempt to unpack them.

# The Nature of Philosophical Writing

Before we dive into today's primary topic, let’s revisit the expectations for your upcoming assignments, particularly how you should approach your philosophy papers. Unlike assignments in other disciplines where you might aim for a comprehensive overview, philosophical writing demands a tighter focus. You will be expected to distill your argument to a crisp point—just one thesis, one objection, and one defense or critique.

The goal here is not to demonstrate everything you know but to show mastery of one specific argument. You’ll likely encounter controversial topics, but rather than striving for an overarching solution, you should aim to explore a narrow issue with depth. This means engaging critically with the readings and the discussions we've had in class.

# Structuring Your Argument

Each paper will be centered around a single issue, and you’ll need to both present and engage with objections to your position. This structure is crucial because it shows that you not only understand your chosen topic but also the criticisms surrounding it. One key element to keep in mind is that this isn't a biology or psychology class—while there might be some overlap with those disciplines, we are primarily concerned with philosophical arguments.

For example, let’s say you want to defend the argument that classical conditioning operates through inferential processes rather than through simple associations. This argument, initially developed by Mitchell and his colleagues, challenges the traditional view of conditioning as merely associative. Your task would be to explore this claim in depth, but narrowly: pick one point of contention, one strong counterargument, and either defend or criticize that counterargument.

# The Importance of Focused Writing

It’s easy to be tempted into writing about everything you’ve learned, but you must resist that urge. You’re writing a short, focused paper, not a dissertation. There’s a time and place for long, in-depth explorations of every angle of a topic, but that’s not the case here. Instead, pick one point and delve into it with precision and clarity. You’ll be judged not on the breadth of your knowledge but on how well you can analyze and argue a single point.

# Choosing Your Topic and the Participation Exercise

You’ll have some flexibility when choosing your topic, but it must come from the set of topics we've covered in class. To help you with this, today’s participation exercise will involve drafting a paragraph about your chosen topic. This paragraph will serve as the basis of an in-class feedback session where you’ll exchange ideas with a partner. Don’t worry—this exercise is not about presenting to the class or being graded on the quality of your paragraph. It’s simply a way to get you thinking critically about your paper early on and to provide you with feedback that could shape your final submission.

This exercise is worth 20% of your participation grade. It’s a pass/fail assignment, so the key is to show up, participate, and engage with the feedback process. Your paragraph doesn’t have to be perfect; it’s a starting point to help you structure your ideas. We won’t be reading or grading your paragraphs directly, but it’s important to treat the exercise seriously since it will shape the direction of your paper.

# Seeking Additional Feedback and Guidance

If you have specific questions about your paper as you begin writing, you are more than welcome to visit during office hours or approach your teaching assistants. While we won’t read full drafts or outline entire papers for you, we can certainly provide feedback on specific sections or address particular challenges you may be facing.

The key is to ask targeted questions—general inquiries like, “How do I make this better?” aren’t as helpful as more focused questions such as, “How do I clarify this argument?” or “Is this objection strong enough?” Your teaching assistants and I can help you sharpen your ideas and arguments, but remember that the goal is for you to grapple with these issues and develop your own voice.

# Philosophy and Controversy

Now, a reminder: this is a philosophy class. Unlike in the sciences, where there might be one correct answer, in philosophy, we are dealing with controversial issues that often have multiple valid perspectives. In your papers, there is no secret formula for choosing the “right” position. You won’t be penalized for choosing one side of an argument over the other. What matters is how well you can defend your position.

Your paper is an opportunity to synthesize the readings and classroom discussions, showing us that you can develop a coherent argument. Remember, we're not grading based on whether or not we agree with your position, but on how well you can argue it. This class is about learning to navigate these difficult issues and express your thoughts clearly, so focus on defending your position with strong reasoning.

# The Challenge of Reading Philosophical Texts

As you continue reading for this course, you’ll notice that the papers we’re studying are not simple textbook explanations but original philosophical articles. This can be challenging, especially if you're not used to this type of writing. Philosophical articles are dense, full of nuanced arguments, and often quite difficult to follow. However, don't be discouraged by this.

A skill you’ll develop throughout this course is the ability to abstract the main argument from these complex texts. When reading, ask yourself, “What are they arguing for?” and “How are they defending that argument?” Philosophical papers often weave between defending a position and addressing objections, which makes it hard to discern the author’s stance. This is normal, and with practice, you'll improve at untangling these dense arguments.

# The Process of Active Reading

If you find yourself struggling with the readings, try this approach: skim the paper before coming to lecture to get a sense of the main arguments. Then, during lecture, we’ll dive into the details. After the lecture, go back and read the paper more carefully. Skimming doesn’t mean ignoring the hard parts, but rather getting a rough idea of the argument before tackling the more difficult sections. Don’t feel pressured to understand everything on the first read; philosophical texts often require multiple readings.

# Scientific Literacy in Philosophy

An important component of this course is developing scientific literacy, which in this context refers to your ability to critically engage with scientific studies, particularly how they relate to philosophical issues. You’ll notice that we often discuss psychological experiments and their implications for philosophical debates, such as the studies on confirmation bias. Confirmation bias, as you know, is the tendency to favor information that supports our pre-existing beliefs and to ignore evidence that contradicts them.

Your goal as a philosopher isn’t just to memorize these studies but to critically analyze them. For instance, if a study claims that people selectively focus on evidence that supports their beliefs, ask yourself why that might be. What alternative explanations could there be? Could the study’s design have influenced the results? Engaging with these questions is part of being scientifically literate in philosophy. It's not enough to simply accept the results; you need to interpret them in the context of broader philosophical questions.

# The Nature of Confirmation Bias

Let's delve a little deeper into confirmation bias, a topic we've touched on before. This cognitive bias has significant implications for how we process information and form beliefs. It's been shown repeatedly in studies that individuals are more likely to accept information that supports their existing beliefs and dismiss information that contradicts them. This bias operates on both a conscious and unconscious level, influencing how we engage with the world.

But here’s where the philosophical question comes in: If confirmation bias is so ingrained in us, can we ever claim to be truly rational agents? Or are we simply reinforcing our own prejudices and biases? This is a question that strikes at the heart of epistemology—the study of knowledge and belief. In your papers, exploring questions like these can lead to deep, rich discussions. You might argue that, despite our biases, we have tools—such as the scientific method or philosophical reasoning—that help us overcome these tendencies. Or, you could take a more skeptical approach and argue that our biases are so ingrained that true objectivity is impossible.

# Cognitive Dissonance: An Overview

Today’s primary focus is cognitive dissonance theory, developed by psychologist Leon Festinger. Cognitive dissonance refers to the mental discomfort we experience when we hold two conflicting beliefs or when our actions contradict our beliefs. This discomfort often motivates us to change either our beliefs or our behavior to reduce the dissonance and restore harmony.

Cognitive dissonance is a powerful force in shaping our attitudes and beliefs, often operating below the level of conscious awareness. What makes this theory so interesting is that it provides a framework for understanding why we sometimes change our minds in the face of weak arguments or even when we’re presented with contradictory evidence.

# How Beliefs Are Formed and Changed

Before we get into how cognitive dissonance leads to belief change, it's essential to understand that the formation of beliefs and the process of changing them are two separate phenomena. Beliefs can be formed through direct experience, learning, social influence, or even as a result of automatic cognitive processes. But changing those beliefs—especially deeply held ones—requires a different set of mechanisms.

Even if you hold a belief with conviction, encountering contradictory evidence can trigger cognitive dissonance. This conflict between belief and evidence leads to discomfort, which we are motivated to reduce. The key point here is that we don’t always resolve dissonance by accepting the new evidence. Sometimes, instead of changing the belief, we might reject the evidence or reinterpret it in a way that fits our existing beliefs. This is how cognitive dissonance can lead to resistance to change, even in the face of overwhelming evidence.

# Classic Cognitive Dissonance Experiment

One of the most famous experiments demonstrating cognitive dissonance involved participants who were asked to complete a boring task—sorting spools. After the task, some participants were paid $1 to tell another participant that the task was enjoyable, while others were paid $20. Interestingly, those who were paid only $1 were more likely to convince themselves that the task had been fun. Why? Because $1 wasn’t enough to justify lying. These participants experienced cognitive dissonance because they had told a lie for a trivial amount of money, so they resolved the dissonance by convincing themselves that the task wasn’t so bad after all.

On the other hand, participants who were paid $20 didn’t experience as much dissonance. The large sum of money provided a sufficient external justification for their lie, so they didn’t feel the need to change their beliefs. They knew they were lying, but they were doing it for a reason—$20. This experiment shows how external rewards and internal motivations interact in complex ways when it comes to belief change.

# Rational Persuasion vs. Cognitive Dissonance

This experiment presents a challenge to the rational persuasion theory, which posits that people change their beliefs based on the strength of the arguments they encounter. According to rational persuasion theory, we would expect the participants who received $20 to change their beliefs more because they had a stronger incentive to reflect on the task and its potential merits. However, cognitive dissonance theory offers a different explanation: it’s not the strength of the argument or the size of the reward that matters, but the internal conflict between what we believe and what we do.

# Intrinsic Motivation and Belief Change

Festinger's cognitive dissonance theory suggests that we are intrinsically motivated to resolve dissonance. This motivation is similar to basic drives like hunger or thirst. Just as we are driven to satisfy hunger by eating, we are driven to resolve cognitive dissonance by making our beliefs consistent with our actions.

However, not all psychologists agree with this interpretation. Some argue that the desire to resolve dissonance is not intrinsic but rather a product of social pressures. They contend that we change our beliefs primarily because we don’t want to appear inconsistent to others, not because we are inherently driven to achieve internal consistency. This debate continues to shape how we understand belief formation and change.

# Cognitive Dissonance in Everyday Life

Cognitive dissonance isn’t just an abstract psychological theory; it plays out in our everyday lives. Think about a time when you’ve made a decision that didn’t align with your beliefs. For example, perhaps you believe in environmental sustainability, but you’ve purchased a product from a company known for environmentally harmful practices. In this situation, you might experience cognitive dissonance. To resolve this, you might change your belief about the company, convincing yourself that they aren’t as harmful as you thought. Or, you might downplay the importance of sustainability in that particular instance to justify your purchase.

We see cognitive dissonance in politics, too. Voters who support a candidate may ignore or reinterpret evidence that contradicts their positive view of the candidate because admitting that their chosen candidate is flawed would create dissonance. This is why cognitive dissonance is so relevant not only in personal decision-making but also in understanding larger social and political phenomena.

# Cognitive Dissonance and Group Dynamics

Another important aspect of cognitive dissonance is how it plays out in group settings. People in groups tend to conform to the dominant beliefs of the group, even when those beliefs conflict with their own. This is because going against the group creates dissonance. Social belonging is a powerful motivator, and when the group’s beliefs conflict with an individual’s personal beliefs, the pressure to resolve that dissonance often leads to conformity. This is one reason why it's so difficult to maintain dissenting opinions within tight-knit communities or political groups.

# Revisiting the Classic Study: Pay and Persuasion

To return to the earlier experiment on cognitive dissonance, let's think more deeply about the implications. The participants who were paid $1 to lie about the boring task experienced cognitive dissonance because the payment was not enough to justify their dishonesty. To resolve the tension between their behavior (lying) and their belief (the task was boring), they convinced themselves that the task was more enjoyable than it actually was. In contrast, participants who were paid $20 had no such need to change their beliefs because they could easily attribute their behavior to the external reward.

What’s fascinating here is that cognitive dissonance theory suggests that we are not always rational agents who are persuaded by better arguments or more evidence. Instead, much of our belief formation is driven by our need to resolve discomfort. This has profound implications for how we understand persuasion, particularly in the context of debates or negotiations.

# The Broader Implications of Cognitive Dissonance Theory

Cognitive dissonance theory has far-reaching implications beyond individual psychology. It helps explain phenomena like confirmation bias, where we selectively gather information that supports our existing beliefs and ignore evidence that contradicts them. This selective filtering can be seen as a way of reducing cognitive dissonance.

In a broader societal context, cognitive dissonance can also explain why people are resistant to change, even when faced with compelling evidence. Whether it's changing attitudes toward climate change, political ideologies, or even personal health behaviors, cognitive dissonance plays a significant role in how we process new information and adjust our beliefs.

# Conclusion: Navigating the Complexity of Belief and Behavior

In conclusion, cognitive dissonance theory provides a robust framework for understanding how and why we change our beliefs. It reveals that belief change is not always a rational process; instead, it's often driven by the need to resolve internal conflicts between our beliefs and our actions. As we move forward in this class, I encourage you to think critically about the ways in which cognitive dissonance might shape not only your own beliefs but also the beliefs of others. Understanding this process will make you more adept at recognizing the complexities of human reasoning and belief formation.
