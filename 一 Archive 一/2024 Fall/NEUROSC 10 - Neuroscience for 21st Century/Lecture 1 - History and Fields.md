What is cognitive psychology? It’s the empirical study of the mind, focusing on how various mental processes work together to create our experience. This involves studying subparts of the mind, such as desires, perceptual skills, visual activities, emotions, and so on. Today marks the first day of our lecture, and we will also touch upon the philosophy of cognitive science, which is a branch of the philosophy of mind that explores theoretical questions and controversies.

As a cognitive science course, this lecture reflects my own background, working across fields such as epistemology (the study of knowledge) and cognitive psychology. Some versions of this course may have leaned more on historical or conceptual perspectives, depending on the research background of the instructor. This course, however, is flexible. I’ll draw on empirical results, but the goal is to equip you with the tools you need to interpret them and to develop your own opinions on the controversies we discuss. There’s no need to worry about having a STEM background.

You’ll learn about philosophical arguments and empirical results from cognitive psychology, but this isn’t a course designed for you to just absorb and regurgitate information. Rather, the aim is to help you develop critical thinking skills. I want you to learn how to bring together arguments and evidence to support your own viewpoints. I’m not here to push my own opinions on you; instead, I want you to build your own well-supported perspectives.

On the philosophy side, we’ll practice evaluating evidence critically, looking at both sides of controversial issues and making solid arguments. On the science side, we’ll examine some cognitive psychology results and discuss how to interpret them. One key point I want you to take away from this course is that interpreting empirical results is tricky. Often, multiple theories can explain the same results, and scientists must triangulate with other studies to get a clearer picture.

One challenge in cognitive psychology is figuring out exactly what hypotheses predict and what further tests should be done. This is why scientists often debate the meaning of their findings. There’s always room for more discussion, especially when empirical results can be interpreted in different ways. This course will help you develop both philosophical reasoning and scientific literacy skills. Scientific literacy doesn’t mean just memorizing facts or outcomes—it involves critically examining research results and interpreting what they mean.

This course is ultimately about subjective experience. It’s about the sensations, emotions, and thoughts we all have—whether it’s feeling content or frustrated, experiencing sharp pain, or believing something will happen. The course also touches on the subjectivity of non-human animals. We’ll attempt to explain subjective experiences, like pain, using more objective facts, though there may be limits to how well we can explain these personal experiences in objective terms.

Philosopher Thomas Nagel famously asked, “What is it like to be a bat?” He argued that while we can study a bat’s biology—its brain, nervous system, and sensory organs—we might never fully understand what it’s like to be a bat. Nagel believes there’s an insurmountable gap between objective facts and subjective experience. This idea contrasts with the views of philosopher Kathleen Akins, who argues that there is much we can infer about subjective experience from scientific facts, though perhaps not everything.

Akins suggests that by studying the bat’s brain and sensory systems, we can gain some insight into its experiences, though we may not grasp all the nuances. This debate touches on a larger question in philosophy and cognitive science: how much can objective science tell us about subjective experience? While some philosophers maintain that subjective experiences cannot be fully explained through objective facts, others argue that science offers valuable insights, even if it cannot explain everything.

We’ll explore foundational issues in cognitive science, such as the nature of subjective experience, and also dive into specific topics like perception, emotion, and thought. For instance, we’ll examine whether our background beliefs influence our perception and how emotion relates to cognition. Are emotions like fear and sadness judgments about the world, or are they more like perceptual states that help us interpret our environment?

We’ll also touch on empathy and compassion. For example, empathy is often described as simulating another person’s experience, but does this really facilitate altruistic behavior? We’ll explore classic studies on empathy, as well as more recent research that questions its role in motivating kindness and compassion.

In terms of logistics, some of the readings will be challenging because they are original texts. However, I don’t assume any prior background, and my lectures are designed to help you understand these materials. This is an introductory class, and we’ll build your skills as we go.

Finally, a quick word of encouragement: It’s common for students to feel like they’re behind, especially in discussion sections where others may seem more confident. But in my experience, there’s little correlation between how confidently someone talks in class and the quality of their work. Don’t hesitate to reach out if you ever feel lost—I’m here to help you succeed.

It's like, miraculous. I want you to talk in the discussion section. I want to hear your voices, right? But if you don't feel as comfortable doing that, it doesn't mean you're less of a student, right? Um, anything else? Let me know. All you have to do is respond to something the TA said, or another student, and try to build on it or ask a question about it.

Irrespective of that, there's nothing fancy about this. Whereas traditional participation in education is like monologuing, I'm trying to encourage you to have a genuine conversation and discussion and to practice being curious about what your peers are saying and to engage in active listening. And so, you will be graded for that.

I know that there are a couple of precepts on that Friday, but don't worry about that. I’ll say more about that in a second. Will I use slides or handouts? I will use slides or handouts, and I will post those to Canvas.

Sometimes it'll be slides, sometimes notes. I just published something on Canvas, I think the syllabus is up, and I need to add a few things. So in general, I expect you to read the materials before you come to the lecture, but not this week because I haven’t posted things yet. But very shortly, you should be able to go to the Canvas page, go to files, and see everything on there. And then, I’ll also post the slides. Feel free to drop me an email if you're missing a set of slides to check out, but they’ll all go up.

If you have to miss a class or lecture, you really need to get notes from a friend because I don't expect you to just look at the slides and figure it all out. It's not a textbook, right? It's just something to supplement what you’ve learned from me in the lecture. So, they’re going to be hard to interpret on their own. Everything is in person, and I do not record lectures. So if you miss a class, please get notes from someone. Exchange emails with a couple of people so that if you have to miss a class, you can combine those notes with the slides or handouts from the day. You're certainly welcome to ask us if you have questions about the material, but we won't have time to recap the entire lecture. However, if you have questions, we can certainly answer them.

Anything else you should know? Yes, don't use your cell phones. It's disrespectful and distracting to others. Please don't use the internet during class, except if you're taking notes. It undermines our collective learning environment if you're browsing the internet, and it's distracting.

During the discussion section, raise one finger if you want to speak. We will prioritize the people who have not yet spoken. This helps us keep track of who has spoken and who hasn’t, but you don't have to speak in every lecture. And you don’t actually have to speak in every discussion section either, but we do want to hear from everyone, not just a few students.

Unfortunately, we are not accepting any more students beyond the waitlist, but I anticipate that some spots will open up. You are welcome to continue attending any lecture. Regarding the discussion section, if you need to be manually added to Canvas or access support materials, just email me or talk to me after class, and I’ll get it set up for you.

There's no way around it. It’s especially important for the discussion section. The idea is that everyone is holding up two fingers to signal twice that they want to speak. It’s just because we prioritize those who haven’t spoken much yet. Both parties have concerns.

We discussed necessary and sufficient conditions earlier. So, what does that mean? A necessary condition is a trait that an entity must have to be that kind of thing. For example, it is a necessary condition for being a triangle that it has three sides. There’s no way to be a triangle unless it has three sides.

The entire world also guarantees that certain traits are sufficient for having those things. For instance, being a dog is sufficient for being an animal. Being born in the U.S. is necessary to become president according to current U.S. law. It’s a necessary condition, but being born in the U.S. is not a sufficient condition to become president—there are other requirements too.

Necessary and sufficient conditions combine to create what we call a definition. For example, something is a triangle if and only if it is a closed, three-sided figure. These examples are meant to help you understand the vocabulary, and we will refer back to them.

Arguments are sets of claims, which together allegedly form a conclusion. These are called premises, or assumptions. When premises, if true, guarantee the truth of the conclusion, we say that the argument is valid. In the technical sense, validity means that if the premises were true, the conclusion would also have to be true.

If an argument's premises are all true and the argument is valid, then the argument is also sound. An argument that is sound must have a true conclusion because its premises, if true, lead to a true conclusion.

Don't worry too much about these terms right now; they may come up later in the quarter.

I’ll try to give you a heads-up through an announcement in lecture or via email, and the most up-to-date syllabus will be on Canvas.

Your final grade will be based on several components. For example, 30% of your grade comes from discussion participation. You’ll be asked to participate in discussion sections, which will be graded. There are 10 grades, each worth four points, totaling 40 points.

There is also an in-class exercise, which is a fancy participation grade. You will write a paragraph describing what you’ll write about for your first paper. We’ll give you topics, and you’ll bring that paragraph to discussion. This is just a short activity that’s worth 20 points, which is half of the participation grade for this class.

I will provide more details about this later in the quarter, so you don’t have to worry about it now. It’s pass/fail. If you don’t want to speak in discussion, you can email your TA with a comment or a question about something someone else said in class. You don’t have to attend every discussion section, but you do have to engage in some way to get credit. You can't miss two or three sessions without making up for it by asking questions or submitting comments.

Lastly, I want to emphasize that this course is designed to assess your participation and your engagement, not just your ability to regurgitate information.

Feel free to email me or your TA with any questions. There is no final exam for this class.
