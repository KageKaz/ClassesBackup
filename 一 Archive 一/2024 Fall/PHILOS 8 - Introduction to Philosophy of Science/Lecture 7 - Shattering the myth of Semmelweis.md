### Lecture on Scientific Theories: Semmelweis, Medical Paradigms, and the Nature of Scientific Confirmation

#### Introduction and Course Logistics

Good afternoon, everyone. I hope you're all doing well. Let’s start today with some quick logistical updates. Next week is going to be a little chaotic for the class. As many of you may have already seen in the syllabus, I won’t be available for Wednesday’s lecture. Immediately after my Monday lecture, I have to rush to catch an Uber to the airport for a conference that’ll keep me away for the rest of the week.

Because of this, Wednesday’s class will be a pre-recorded lecture covering **Probability Theory**. It’s fairly elementary, so don’t worry too much if you’re unfamiliar with the topic. The math is straightforward—just basic operations like addition, subtraction, and multiplication. Nothing fancy, I promise. Since I won’t be around to answer questions in real time, the **teaching assistants (TAs)** have graciously agreed to hold an extra office hour. Feel free to reach out to them with any questions or concerns. You can also send me emails, but I’ll be a bit slow to respond because of the conference.

Alright, with that out of the way, let’s get into today’s topic. We’re going to examine the work of **Donna Pulachek**, an associate professor at Virginia University. She’s written extensively on topics related to **scientific progress**, particularly how scientific theories are accepted or rejected by communities. She’s also a public intellectual who has appeared on CNN, NPR, and other popular media outlets to discuss her views on the philosophy of science. One of her major contributions involves a critique of how historical scientific figures like **Ignaz Semmelweis**—the Hungarian physician famous for his discovery of handwashing to prevent childbed fever—are evaluated by historians and philosophers of science.

Our goal today is to revisit the puzzle from last week, which revolved around Semmelweis’s hypothesis about **childbed fever**. We’ll look at how Pulachek critiques previous interpretations, particularly those offered by Donald Gillies, and explore her take on the relationship between scientific theories, evidence, and community acceptance. Ultimately, we’re going to dig into whether scientific hypotheses are accepted based purely on evidence or if other factors, like paradigms, play a role.

#### Revisiting the Puzzle: The Case of Semmelweis

Let’s start by revisiting the **Semmelweis puzzle** we discussed last week. This puzzle hinges on three conflicting claims about the history of Semmelweis’s theory:

1. The **confirmation claim**: Semmelweis’s hypothesis—that childbed fever was caused by cadaveric material being transmitted from doctors to patients—was well-confirmed by evidence at the time.
2. The **rejection claim**: Despite this, the scientific community in the 1840s **rejected** his hypothesis.
3. The **community claim**: Scientific communities tend to accept well-confirmed hypotheses, meaning that if a hypothesis is confirmed by evidence, it should be accepted by the scientific community.

The question, then, is how can these three claims be reconciled? If Semmelweis’s hypothesis was truly well-confirmed by the evidence, why did the scientific community reject it? And if they rejected it, does this mean that well-confirmed hypotheses can still be dismissed by the scientific community, thereby challenging the **community claim**?

This tension has been explored by numerous philosophers, including **Donald Gillies**, who uses **Thomas Kuhn's theory of paradigms** to explain what happened in Semmelweis’s case. According to Kuhn, science doesn’t progress linearly but rather through shifts in paradigms—frameworks that dictate how scientists view the world and interpret evidence. So, Gillies argues that the rejection of Semmelweis’s hypothesis wasn’t due to any irrationality or prejudice but because Semmelweis’s theory didn’t fit within the **medical paradigm** of the 1840s.

#### Kuhn’s Influence: Paradigms and the Semmelweis Case

Gillies builds his explanation on Kuhn’s concept of **paradigm shifts**, where periods of "normal science" are punctuated by revolutions that dramatically change the fundamental assumptions of the scientific community. In the 1840s, the dominant medical paradigm categorized diseases into two main types:

- **Miasmatic diseases**: These were thought to be caused by **airborne vapors** (miasma) that carried poisonous particles through the air.
- **Contagious diseases**: These were understood as diseases transmitted directly from one individual to another, typically through **direct contact**.

Semmelweis’s hypothesis didn’t fit neatly into either of these categories. He proposed that **childbed fever** was being transmitted by doctors who were carrying cadaveric particles on their hands after performing autopsies, but this wasn’t a miasmatic disease, since it wasn’t transmitted through the air. Nor was it strictly a contagious disease, because it wasn’t transmitted directly from an infected person to a healthy person. Instead, the transmission occurred through indirect contact with the cadaveric material carried by doctors.

This, according to Gillies, explains why Semmelweis’s hypothesis was rejected. It didn’t conform to the 1840s medical paradigm, which lacked the conceptual tools to understand what we now know as **bacterial transmission**. As Gillies argues, **Semmelweis’s hypothesis** wasn’t well-confirmed by the standards of the **1840s paradigm** but became well-confirmed later, when the **germ theory of disease** replaced the miasmatic and contagion models.

Gillies’s view is that scientific confirmation is always relative to the **paradigm** in which a theory is evaluated. He claims that while Semmelweis’s hypothesis didn’t make sense within the 1840s paradigm, it became highly confirmed when the medical community shifted its framework to accommodate **germ theory**. Thus, Gillies believes that the rejection of Semmelweis’s hypothesis was justified within its historical context, but the theory’s eventual acceptance demonstrates how **paradigm shifts** can change what counts as confirmation.

#### Pulachek’s Critique: Rejecting the Paradigm Model

Now, let’s move to **Pulachek’s critique**. She challenges the idea that **paradigms** played a decisive role in Semmelweis’s case and, by extension, in scientific progress more broadly. According to Pulachek, Gillies and others who follow Kuhn’s model are overstating the degree to which the medical community was bound by paradigmatic thinking in the 1840s.

Pulachek argues that the medical landscape of the time wasn’t **paradigmatic** in the Kuhnian sense at all. In her view, the medical community of the 1840s was much more **diffuse** in its approach to disease causation. There was no strong, unified consensus around the miasmatic or contagion models, which means there wasn’t a single paradigm that Semmelweis’s hypothesis needed to fit into. Instead, medical thinking was more fragmented, and there wasn’t enough of a **shared scientific consensus** to constitute a true paradigm in Kuhn’s terms.

This is a critical difference between Gillies and Pulachek. While Gillies sees the rejection of Semmelweis’s hypothesis as a result of his theory’s incompatibility with the reigning paradigm, Pulachek suggests that there was no coherent paradigm for Semmelweis to challenge in the first place.

#### Semmelweis’s Hypothesis: Was It Really Revolutionary?

Pulachek takes her critique further by questioning whether Semmelweis’s hypothesis was truly as **revolutionary** as it’s often made out to be. Gillies, following Kuhn, presents Semmelweis as a pioneer whose ideas were far ahead of his time, rejected because they didn’t fit into the existing paradigm. However, Pulachek argues that many of the core ideas underlying Semmelweis’s hypothesis were already **circulating** within the medical community before he proposed them.

For instance, by the **1790s**, it was already known that doctors and midwives could transmit childbed fever to mothers even if they weren’t sick themselves. There were documented cases where medical practitioners, despite not suffering from the disease, acted as carriers, spreading the infection to mothers during childbirth. Pulachek highlights that this idea of **indirect transmission** was not new to Semmelweis’s time, nor was it considered particularly radical. Therefore, she argues that Semmelweis’s hypothesis was less of a **paradigm-shifting breakthrough** and more of a logical extension of ideas that were already present in the medical community.

#### Monocausality and Its Flaws

A key part of Pulachek’s critique focuses on Semmelweis’s commitment to **monocausality**, the idea that there was one single cause for childbed fever—namely, cadaveric particles transmitted by doctors. Pulachek points out that this commitment to monocausality was a major **weakness** of Semmelweis’s theory. The 1840s medical community recognized that diseases often had **multiple causes**, and they were skeptical of any theory that claimed to explain a complex disease with a single, straightforward cause.

According to Pulachek, this skepticism was justified. Childbed fever occurred even in hospitals where **no autopsies** were performed, and it was also reported in **home births**, where there was no obvious source of cadaveric material. These cases contradicted Semmelweis’s theory and suggested that cadaveric particles couldn’t be the sole cause of the disease. In fact, many doctors argued that **environmental factors**, including sanitation practices and the overall health of the mother, played a significant role in the transmission of childbed fever.

In short, Semmelweis’s theory was rejected not because of paradigm-related issues, as Gillies suggests, but because it **failed** to account for the **complexity** of the disease. The scientific community was justified in demanding more evidence and in pointing out the gaps in Semmelweis’s reasoning.

#### The Complexity of Contagion and Disease Models

Another major point Pulachek raises is that the concept of **contagious diseases** was far more nuanced in the 1840s than Gillies’s interpretation suggests. Gillies portrays the medical community as being locked into a simplistic view of disease causation, divided strictly between **miasmatic** and **contagion** models. However, Pulachek argues that doctors of the time had a much more **sophisticated** understanding of disease transmission.

For example, many doctors recognized that diseases could be **contagious** under certain conditions but not under others. Factors like the **weather**, a person’s **mood**, or their **emotional state** could all affect whether they were more or less likely to contract a disease. Moreover, the medical community acknowledged that diseases often involved **predisposing** and **exciting** causes, meaning that a combination of factors could contribute to the onset of illness.

Pulachek’s argument here is that Gillies oversimplifies the medical paradigm of the 1840s, making it seem more rigid and dogmatic than it actually was. In reality, the medical community’s understanding of diseases was much more **flexible** and **adaptive** than Gillies gives them credit for. This flexibility allowed doctors to engage with and critique Semmelweis’s hypothesis in a **rational** and scientifically **legitimate** way.

#### Rejecting the Confirmation Claim

Ultimately, Pulachek’s solution to the puzzle is to reject the **confirmation claim**. She argues that **Semmelweis’s hypothesis** was not well-confirmed by the standards of his time. The **evidence** was too weak, and there were too many **counterexamples** for the hypothesis to be considered robust. As we’ve seen, childbed fever occurred in settings where there was no cadaveric material, and there were documented fluctuations in the disease’s incidence that Semmelweis’s theory couldn’t explain.

Therefore, according to Pulachek, the scientific community’s rejection of Semmelweis’s hypothesis was perfectly **rational**. They had legitimate **concerns** about the theory’s ability to explain all the available evidence, and Semmelweis’s failure to address these concerns meant that his hypothesis was rightly rejected.

#### Implications for Theories of Confirmation

Pulachek’s critique has far-reaching implications for how we think about **confirmation theory** in the philosophy of science. One of the major issues that arises in discussions of scientific confirmation is whether **evidence** alone is enough to confirm a hypothesis, or whether other factors, such as the **scientific community’s** pre-existing beliefs and assumptions, play a role.

Gillies’s Kuhnian explanation suggests that confirmation is always **relative** to a **paradigm**—that is, a hypothesis is only confirmed within the context of the dominant scientific framework of the time. However, Pulachek’s critique challenges this view. She argues that we don’t need to appeal to paradigms to explain why certain hypotheses are accepted or rejected. Instead, we can evaluate scientific reasoning on its **own terms**, looking at the **quality** of the evidence and the **strength** of the arguments.

In the case of Semmelweis, Pulachek shows that the rejection of his hypothesis was based on **good scientific reasoning**, not on some incompatibility with a reigning paradigm. The medical community of the 1840s raised valid criticisms of Semmelweis’s theory, and their rejection of it was consistent with the standards of evidence they held. This suggests that **confirmation theory** can still be useful without needing to invoke Kuhn’s **paradigm shifts**.

#### Conclusion: Pulachek’s Straightforward Solution

In conclusion, Pulachek provides a compelling alternative to the Kuhnian paradigm-based explanation of the Semmelweis case. Her critique of Gillies shows that Semmelweis’s hypothesis wasn’t rejected due to irrationality or a rigid adherence to outdated paradigms. Instead, it was rejected because it **failed** to meet the standards of evidence and reasoning that the scientific community expected. By rejecting the **confirmation claim**, Pulachek resolves the puzzle in a way that avoids many of the challenges posed by Kuhn’s theory, including the issue of **relativism**.

Her argument demonstrates that scientific communities can reject well-confirmed hypotheses for **valid** reasons, and that these reasons don’t necessarily involve paradigms. Instead, the rejection of a hypothesis can be based on legitimate concerns about the **scope**, **simplicity**, and **explanatory power** of the theory in question. Pulachek’s critique invites us to rethink how we approach the history of science and how we evaluate the reasons behind the acceptance or rejection of scientific theories.

Alright, I think that covers most of today’s material. Let’s open it up for questions. Does anyone want to dig deeper into Pulachek’s arguments or explore the broader implications of her critique for how we understand scientific reasoning?
